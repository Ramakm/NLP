Furthermore
,
when
all

were
analyzed
,
regardless
of

status
but
limited

,
the

As
the
ambient
temperature
increases
,
there
is
an
increase
in
insensible
fluid
loss
and
the
potential
for
dehydration

The
daily
high
temperature
ranged
from
71
to
104
degrees
F
and
AFI
values
ranged
from
1.7
to
24.7

during
the

period

There
was
a
significant
correlation
between
the
2-
,
3-
,
and
4-day
mean
temperature
and
AFI
,
with
the

mean
being
the
most
significant
(

Fluctuations
in

This
study
tested
the
hypothesis
that
to
reduce
the
rate
of
macrosomic
infants
in
gestational
diabetes
cases
,
good
glycemic
control
should
be
initiated
before
34
completed

In
the
``
early
''
and
``
late
''
groups
,
mean
gestational
age
at
the
beginning
of
treatment
was
30.0
+/-
3.8
and
36.2
+/-
1.2
weeks
,
and
duration
of
treatment
was
9.6
+/-
4.1
and
3.7
+/-
1.8

,
respectively

The
rate
of
macrosomic
and
large-for-gestational-age
infants
were
5
and
11
%
,
respectively
,
in
the
early

In
our

,
we
specifically
analyzed
the
role
played
by
advanced
maternal
age
and
sonographically
discovered
abnormalities
in
the
detection
of
autosomal
trisomies

All
together
,
27
fetuses
had
this

,
representing
28.7
%
(
27
of
94
)
of
all
cytogenetic
aberrations
detected
at
our
center
over
the
same
period

The
most
common
indication
leading
to
diagnosis
was
abnormal
ultrasound
finding
(
48.2
%
)
,
followed
by
advanced
maternal
age
(
44.4
%
)

However
,
63
%
of
the
trisomic
fetuses
belonged
to
mothers
aged
35
years
and
above

Trisomy

fetuses
showed
hydramnios
,
intrauterine

,
microcephaly
,
spina

,
and
nonimmune
hydrops

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
if
the
rate
of
preeclampsia
is
increased
in
triplet

compared
to
twin
gestations

These
were
matched
for
maternal
age
,

,
and
race
to
twin
gestations
(
N
=

)
from
the

population

The
rate
of
severe
preeclampsia
was
increased
significantly
in
the
triplet
group
12
of
53
(
22.6

)
as
compared
with
the

We
conducted

in
five
Ohio

The

,
hepatosplenomegaly
,
and

The

)

Right

were
present

Sequelae
include

SETTING
:
Clinic
populations
in
the

resulted
in
maximum

)
of
1.5
,
2.6

,
and
2.3
for
these

,
with
a
peak

A

genotype
identified
27
families
that
had
at
least
1
member
with
AD
whose
genotype
did
not
contain
an
APOE*4
allele

CONCLUSIONS
:
A
complete
genomic
screen
in
families
affected
with
late-onset
AD
identified
4
regions
of
interest
after
follow-up

Chromosome
12
gave
the
strongest
and
most
consistent
results
with
a
peak
multipoint
MLS
of
3.5
,
suggesting
that
this
region
contains
a
new
susceptibility
gene
for
AD

CONTEXT
:
A
mutation
in
the
BRCA1
gene
may
confer
substantial
risk
for
breast
and/or
ovarian
cancer

DESIGN
:
A
complete
sequence
analysis
of
the
BRCA1
coding
sequence
and
flanking
intronic
regions
was
performed
in
798
women
in
a
collaborative
effort
involving
institutions
from
the
United
States
,
Italy
,
Germany
,
Finland
,
and
Switzerland

PARTICIPANTS
:
Institutions
selected
798
persons
representing
families
(
1
person
for
each
family
)
thought
to
be
at
elevated
a
priori
risk
of
BRCA1
mutation
due
to
potential
risk
factors
,
such
as
multiple
cases
of
breast
cancer
,
early
age
of
breast
cancer
diagnosis
,
and
cases
of
ovarian
cancer

RESULTS
:
In
102
women
(
12.8
%
)
,
clearly
deleterious
mutations
were
detected

In
a
subset
of
71
Ashkenazi
Jewish
women
,
only
2
distinct
deleterious
mutations
were
found
:
185delAG
in
17
cases
and
5382insC
in
7
cases

CONCLUSIONS
:
Using
logistic
regression
analysis
,
we
provide
a
method
for
evaluating
the
probability
of
a
woman
's
carrying
a
deleterious
BRCA1
mutation
for
a
wide
range
of
cases
,
which
can
be
an
important
tool
for
clinicians
as
they
incorporate
genetic
susceptibility
testing
into
their
medical
practice

CONTEXT
:
Approximately
9
%
of
prostate
cancer
cases
have
been
estimated
to
result
from
inheritance
of
mutated
prostate
cancer
susceptibility
genes

Few
data
exist
as
to
whether
there
are
clinical
differences
between
prostate
cancers
that
are
inherited
and
those
that
occur
in
the
general
population

DESIGN
:
Retrospective
case
study
in
which
clinical
data
were
extracted
from
medical
and
pathological
records

FAMILIES
:
A
total
of
74
North
American
families
with
hereditary
prostate
cancer

CONCLUSIONS
:
Families
that
provide
evidence
for
segregation
of
an
altered
HPC1
gene
are
characterized
by
multiple
cases
of
prostate
cancer
that
,
in
most
respects
,
are
indistinguishable
from
nonhereditary
cases

However
,
except
for
genes
in
the
HLA
system
,
specific
susceptibility
loci
are
unknown
or
unconfirmed

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
several
loci
spanning
3
candidate
regions
for
a
role
in
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS
)
susceptibility
in
2
ethnic
groups
using
both
single-locus
and
haplotype
analyses

DESIGN
:
Case-control
association
testing

Variation
within
the
MBP
locus
on
chromosome
18q23
showed
no
effect
in
MS

D19S574
showed
a
significant
effect
(
P=.015
)
in
Caucasian
patients
with
MS
due
to
the
increased
frequency
of
a
single
allele
(
P=.002
)

Interaction
effects
between
DR2
and
chromosome
19q13.2
or
MBP
in
MS
susceptibility
were
not
apparent

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
significant
chromosome
19q13.2
single-locus
and
multilocus
haplotype
associations
with
MS
in
Caucasian
and
Chinese
patient
samples
indicate
an
effect
from
a
nearby
disease
susceptibility
locus

These
initial
observations
are
an
encouraging
step
toward
the
description
of
non-HLA
genetic
susceptibility
to
MS

The
objective
of
this
article
is
to
explore
attitudes
of
an
inner-city

about

HIV-related
prenatal
care

However
,
the
association
of
parvovirus

has
not
been
reported

In

,

portends
for
a

outcome

Results
of
early
rehabilitation
seem
to
be
influenced
by
duration
and
etiology
of
deafness
,
experience
with
hearing
aids
,
and
other
factors

Signals
have
qualitative
and
quantitative
aspects

Type
C
effects
(
those
effects
related
to
an
increased
frequency
of
'spontaneous
'
disease
)
are
difficult
to
study
,
however
,
and
continue
to
pose
a
pharmacoepidemiological
challenge

Seven
basic
considerations
can
be
identified
that
determine
the
evidence
contained
in
a
signal
:
quantitative
strength
of
the
association
,
consistency
of
the
data
,
exposure
response
relationship
,
biological
plausibility
,
experimental
findings
,
possible
analogies
and
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
data

A
double-blind
,
crossover
design
was
used
to
compare
the
effects
of
methylphenidate
versus
placebo
on
an
electroencephalogram
,
AED
levels
,
and
the
CPT

There
were
no
significant
changes
in
AED
levels
or
electroencephalographic
findings

CONCLUSION
:
Methylphenidate
is
effective
in
treating
children
with
epilepsy
and
ADHD
and
safe
in
children
who
are
seizure
free

An
LRP
was
only
observed
on
no-go
trials
when
the
semantic
(
not
the
phonological
)
decision
determined
the
response
hand

These
results
provide
electrophysiological
evidence
for
early
semantic
activation
and
later
phonological
encoding

,
IVF-embryo

Sera
were
drawn
12

in
non-IVF
cycles
or
9

after
ET
and
were

and
beta
human
chorionic
gondotropin

Comparison
of
the
frequency
of
lymphocyte
expression
of
PIBF
in
pregnant

were
made

RESULTS
:
PIBF
was
detected
in
29.5
%
of
non-pregnant
women
and
52.5
%
of
pregnant
women

It
is
generally
assumed
that
abiotic
synthesis
of
amino
acids
on
the
early
Earth
resulted
in
racemic
mixtures
(
L-
and
D-enantiomers
in
equal
abundance
)

But
the
origin
of
life
required
,
owing
to
conformational
constraints
,
the
almost
exclusive
selection
of
either
L-
or
D-enantiomers
,
and
the
question
of
why
living
systems
on
the
Earth
consist
of
L-enantiomers
rather
than
D-enantiomers
is
unresolved

Here
we
show
that
individual
amino-acid
enantiomers
from
Murchison
are
enriched
in
15N
relative
to
their
terrestrial
counterparts
,
so
confirming
an
extraterrestrial
source
for
an
L-enantiomer
excess
in
the
Solar
System
that
may
predate
the
origin
of
life
on
the
Earth

After
adjusting
for
stage
,
factors
such
as
poverty
,
other
socioeconomic
conditions
,
and
treatment
did
not
further
explain
the
remaining

deficit

This
study
examined
the

of
colon

in
blacks
and

to
explore
its

in
the

differences

Similar
B/W
differences
were
observed
for
patients
with
advanced
disease
but
not
with
early
stage

A
key
feature
of
the
method
is
isolation

reverse

of

followed
by
PCR
amplification
of

The
advantages
and

of
this
new
method
are
discussed
in
the
light
of
the

The

were

therapy
;
and
group
C
muscles
(
n

)
were
given
electrical
muscle
stimulation
(
EMS
)
therapy

The
effectiveness
of
treatment
was
assessed
by
conducting
three
measurements
on
each
muscle
before
and
immediately
after
treatment
:
subjective
pain
intensity
(
(
PI
)
with
a
visual
analog
scale
)
,
pressure
pain
threshold
(
(
PT
)
with
algometry
)
,
and
range
of
motion
(
(
ROM
)
with
a
goniometer
)
of
upper
trapezius
muscle
(
lateral
bending
of
cervical
spine
to
the
opposite
side
)

When
the
effectiveness
of
treatment
was
compared
with
that
of
the
placebo
group
(
group
A
)
,
there
was
significant
improvement
in
PI
and
PT
in
group
B
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.01
)
but
not
in
group
C
(
P
>
0.05
)

When
each
group
was
divided
into
two
additional
subgroups
based
on
the
initial
PI
,
it
was
found
that
ENS
could
reduce
PI
and
increase
PT
significantly
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
,
but
did
not
significantly
(
P
>
0.05
)
improve
ROM
,
as
compared
with
the
placebo
group
for
both
subgroups

It
could
reduce
PI
significantly
more
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
than
placebo
controls
only
for
the
subgroup
with
mild
to
moderate
pain
,
but
not
with
severe
pain

For
pain
relief
,
ENS
was
significantly
better
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
than
EMS
;
but
for
the
improvement
of
ROM
,
EMS
was
significantly
better
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
than
ENS

It
is
concluded
that
ENS
is
more
effective
for
immediate
relief
of
myofascial
trigger
point
pain
than
EMS
,
and
EMS
has
a
better
effect
on
immediate
release
of
muscle
tightness
than
ENS

OBJECTIVES
:
Obesity
is
an
important
clinical
problem
,
and
the
use
of
dexfenfluramine
hydrochloride
for
weight
reduction
has
been
widely
publicized
since
its
approval
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration

Our
purpose
was
to
systematically
review
data
on
brain
serotonin
neurotoxicity
in
animals
treated
with
fenfluramines
and
the
evidence
linking
fenfluramines
to
primary
pulmonary
hypertension
(
PPH
)

Appetite
suppressants-most
commonly
fenfluramines
-increase
the
risk
of
developing
PPH
(
odds
ratio
,
6.3
)
,
particularly
when
used
for
more
than
3
months
(

)

It
is
not
known
if
such
damage
occurs
in
humans
or
if
there
are
clinical
consequences

Future
studies
should
address
the
long-term
consequences
of
prolonged
use
of
fenfluramines

The

The

including
incidence
and
etiology

The
article
stresses
behavioral
treatment
modalities
that
eliminate
the
debilitating
phobia

The
effect
was
most
pronounced
in
the
central
part
of
the
treated
area
,
where
no
positive
fox
was
found
in
the
2
months
before
the
end
of
the
trial

The
study
was
controlled
for
other
factors
that
could
influence
the
parasite
's
prevalence
,
such
as
the
availability
of
intermediate
hosts

multilocularis
from
wild
hosts
has
been
demonstrated
,
the
question
of
its
long-term
efficacy
and
other
unresolved
problems
have
to
be
addressed
by
consecutive
studies
before
routine
application
can
be
recommended

In
contrast
,
purified
primary
normal
progenitors
maintained
under
the
same
conditions
die
rapidly

In
fact
,
time
course
studies
demonstrated
an
even
faster
onset
of
apoptosis
in
ceramide-treated
BCR-ABL+
BAF3
cells
as
compared
to
normal
controls

BCR-ABL+
cells
treated
with
ceramide
also
showed
a
rapid
and
sequential
increase
in
the
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
p210
(
BCR-ABL
)
,
p46-56SHC
and
p120Cbl

These
findings
suggest
growth
factor
deprivation
and
treatment
with
TNF-alpha
or
ceramide
trigger
different
initial
events
both
of
which
can
lead
to
apoptosis
in
factor-dependent
hematopoietic
cells

Here
we
show
that
the
medial
temporal
region
is
active
during
encoding
and
that
the
hemisphere
activated
and
the
amount
of
activation
depend
on
the
type
of
stimulus
presented
(
objects
or
words
)
,
whether
the
stimulus
can
be
encoded
for
meaning
(
real
objects
and
words
versus
nonsense

)
,
and

(

the
second
time

Transiently
evolked
otoacoustic
emissions
(
TEOAE
)
have
been
reported
in
several
studies
as
absent
in
a
small
minority
of
normal
ears

In
order
to
understand
and
model
cochlear
processes
involved
in
TEOAE
generation
,
it
needs
to
be
known
whether
the
presence
of
normal
hearing
leads
automatically
to
generation
of
TEOAEs

The
present
study
set
out
to
establish
in
a
large
sample
if
any
ears
could
be
found
that
lacked
TEOAEs
despite
normal
hearing
threshold
levels
(
HTL
)

However
,
careful
visual
assessment
of
the
recorded
waveforms
for
the
remaining
ears
did
not
unequivocally
show
absence
of
TEOAE
characteristics
in
any
ear
with
normal
HTLs

The
function
of
the
short
form
was
examined
after
cotransfection
of
both
the
long
and
short
forms

These
results
clearly
show
that
the
short
form
acts
as
a
dominant
negative
inhibitor
through
the
formation
of
inactive
heterodimers
,
resulting
in
an
inhibition
of
Janus
kinase
2
(
JAK2
)
activation

The
present
study
also
investigates
the
possible
participation
of
cytoplasmic
receptors
in
the
signal
transduction
pathway
,
using
cotransfection
experiments
and
a
new
approach
that
selectively
determines
the
contribution
of
cytoplasmic
receptors
in
the
process
of
signal
transduction

This
partial
recovery
is
also
parallel
to
the
partial
activation
of
JAK2
,
indicating
that
the
signal
transduction
pathway
implicated
JAK2

METHODS
:
40

INTERPRETATION
:
G-CSF
treatment
was
associated
with
improved

outcome
of
foot

in
diabetic
patients

The
absolute
difference
was
0.44
percent
,
with
a
one-sided
95
percent
upper
boundary
of
1.49
percent
,
which
exceeded
the
prespecified
upper
limit
of
0.40
percent
to
indicate
equivalence
in
30-day
mortality
between
the
two
regimens

The
respective
rates
of
any
stroke
and
of
hemorrhagic
stroke
were
1.92
and
1.12
percent
after
double-bolus

and
0.81
percent
after
an
accelerated
infusion
of
alteplase
(
P=0.24
and
P=0.23

CONCLUSIONS
:
Double-bolus
alteplase
was
not
shown
to
be
equivalent
,
according
to
the
prespecified
criteria
,
to
accelerated
infusion
with

There
was
also
a

OBJECTIVE
:
To
estimate

of
patients
died
within

Overall
,
the
age-specific
rates
for
both

rose
with
age
,
with
the
rates
for
women
being
higher
at
all

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:

CONCLUSION
:
Calcium
supplementation
during

is
associated
with
lower

pressure
in
the
offspring
,
particularly
among
overweight
children

The

These
results
indicate
that
the

characteristics
as
that
achieved
by

PURPOSE
:
The
American
Urological
Association
convened
the
Female
Stress
Urinary
Incontinence
Clinical
Guidelines
Panel
to
analyze
the
literature
regarding
surgical
procedures
for
treating
stress
urinary
incontinence
in
the
otherwise
healthy
female
subject
and
to
make
practice
recommendations
based
on
the
treatment
outcomes
data

MATERIALS
AND
METHODS
:
The
panel
searched
the
MEDLINE
data
base
for
all
articles
through
1993
on
surgical
treatment
of
female
stress
urinary
incontinence

Outcomes
data
were
extracted
from
articles
accepted
after
panel
review

The
evidence
supports
surgery
as
initial
therapy
and
as
a
secondary
form
of
therapy
after
failure
of
other
treatments
for
stress
urinary
incontinence

This
did
not
increase
with
an
infusion
of
30
mcg/kg

which
resulted

in
the
cardiac
output
from
1.96
to
5.46
l/min

BACKGROUND
:
For
more
than
30
years
it
has
been
known
that
gastric
acid
secretion
is
inversely
related
to
the
extent
and
severity
of
corpal
gastritis

METHODS
:
Basal
acid
output
(
BAO
)
and
maximal
acid
output
(
MAO
)
were
assessed
in
11
H.
pylori-infected
dyspeptic
patients
(
8
women
and
3
men
;
mean
age
,
28
years
)
before
and
after
successful
anti-H

pylori
therapy

We
hypothesize
that
there
is
a
higher
incidence
of
preeclampsia
(
proteinuric
hypertension
)
in
women
conceiving
by
intrauterine
insemination
with
donor
sperm
versus
intrauterine
insemination
with
partner
sperm

Three
cases
of
mild
preeclampsia
were
found
in
the
partner
insemination
program
and
nine
cases
of
preeclampsia
(
five
severe
,
four
mild
)
in
the
donor
insemination
program
(
relative
risk
1.85
,
95
%
confidence
interval
1.20
to
2.85
)
.

The
antigenic
factor
would
appear
to
be
located
on
the
sperm
as
opposed
to
the
seminal
fluid
itself

Radical
reactions
can
cause
mutations
,
inactivation
or
a
decrease
in
the
turnover
of
mitochondrial
DNA
which
is
more
vulnerable
than
the
nuclear
genoma
to
the
attack
of
mutagenic
agents
,
acting
also
as
a
continuous
source
of
initial
and/or
promoting
factors
of
the
carcinogenetic
process

The
somatic
cells
become
senescent
because
during
cell
division
,
they
lose
the
mechanisms
for
the
lengthening
of
the
telomere

Switch
substrate
retrovectors
(
SSR
)
contain
a
long-terminal
repeat-driven
neomycin
(
Neo
)
gene
for
proviral
chromosomal
maintenance
(
pre-
and
post-S
recombination
)
and
a
CMV
promoter-driven
,
chimeric
hygromycin-thymidine
kinase
(
Hytk
)
gene
(
flanked
by
S

and
S
gamma
2b
recombination
targets
)
to
select
for
(
ganciclovir
)
and
against
(
hygromycin
B
)
S
region
recombination

The
retro-substrates
'
strong
,
constitutive
promoters
ensure
that
variations
in
cellular

activities
are
independent
of

The
pre-

was
matched
with
demographic
data

RESULTS
:
The
prevalence
of
chemical

in
the
antenatal
population
was
2.8
%
and
5.6
%
in
the
postnatal
population

Cloacal

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
whether
patients
with
myocardial
amyloidosis
due
either
to
AL
(
primary
)
amyloid
or
familial
amyloid
have
distinguishing
echocardiographic
or
electrocardiographic
features
;
and
to
compare
the
prevalence
of
heart
failure
and
survival
in
the
two
types
of
amyloidosis
in
relation
to
echocardiographic
findings

PATIENTS
:
36
patients
with
cardiac
amyloid
heart
disease
,
of
whom
12
had
familial
and
24
had
primary
AL
amyloidosis

Retinopathy
was
assessed
by
ophthalmoscopy
after
pupillary
dilation
and
classified
as
any
retinopathy
or
as
nonproliferative
and
proliferative

Diagnostic
peritoneal
lavage
is
an
easily
performed
and
inexpensive
test
that
may
be
useful
in
this
situation

Intra-abdominal

was
present
in
32
(

)
of
these
patients

The
senior

correctly
predicted
the

CONCLUSIONS
:
Clinical
judgment
is
highly
accurate
in
separating
patients
with
tangential
gunshot
wounds
to
the
abdomen
from
those
with

BACKGROUND
:
The
cause
of
severe
acquired
hyperammonemia
,
an
uncommon
but
often
fatal
complication
of
organ
transplantation
and
chemotherapy
for
cancer
,
is
obscure

The
activity
of
hepatic
glutamine
synthetase
was
markedly
reduced
(
in
patient
1
,
12
%
of
the
mean
value
in
controls
;
in
patient
2
,
28
%
of
the
mean
value
in
controls
)
,
and
a
concomitant
reduction
in
the
amount
of
glutamine
synthetase
protein
was
observed

Postnatal
growth
was
prospectively
measured
from
birth
to
1
y
in
54
term
infants
born
small
for
gestational
age
(
SGA
)
,
fed
either
breast
milk
or
a
standard
term
infant
formula

Breastfeeding
was
associated
with
a
0.36
and
0.64
standard
deviation
(
SD
)
increase
in
weight
at
2
weeks
and
3
months
of
age
,
respectively
,
which
persisted
beyond
the
breastfeeding
period
(
0.64
SD
at
1
y
)

This
increased
growth
was
independent
of
potentially
confounding
obstetric
,
social
and
demographic
factors

However
,
it
may
be
even
more
important
that
the
nurses
themselves
have
a
healthy
lifestyle
,
thus
serving
as
role
models
for
patients

Descriptive
statistics
were
used
to
analyze
the
data
retrieved
from
the
questionnaires

RESULTS
:
More
than
70
%
of
the
critical
care
nurses
who
responded
engage
in
exercise
and
follow
a
healthy
,
low-fat
diet

Seventy-one
percent
said
that
they
anticipate
making
a
change
in
their
lifestyle
in
the
future
,
and
70
%
said
that
they
would
recommend
their
lifestyle
to
their
patients

(

)
Incorporating
a
healthy
lifestyle
was
easy
for
some
and
a
struggle
for
others

(

)
Critical
care
nurses
readily
listed
barriers
to
healthy
living

The
CYP1A1
MspI
heterozygous
genotype
was
present
in
18
percent
of
cases
and
16
percent
of
controls
,
and
one
percent
of
cases
and
controls
were
CYP1A1
MspI
homozygous
variant

The
GSTM1
null
genotype
was
detected
in
54
percent
of
cases
and
52
percent
of
controls

BACKGROUND
:
Thrombolytic
treatment
has
been
shown
to
accelerate
resolution
of
major
pulmonary
embolism
and
lead
to
a
rapid
improvement
of
right-side
hemodynamics

Symptom
onset
was
acute
(
&
#
60
;
48
hours
)
in
63
%
of
patients

Clinical
factors
associated
with
a
higher
death

were
syncope
(
P=.012
)
,
arterial
hypotension
(
P=.021
)
,
history
of
congestive
heart
failure
(
P=.013

,
and
chronic
pulmonary
disease
(
P=.032
)

However
,
only
primary
thrombolysis
was
found
by
multivariate
analysis
to
be
an
independent

A
66-year-old
male
engineer
diagnosed
with
malignant
pleural
mesothelioma
4
years
previously
had
thoracotomy
,
radiotherapy
,
and
chemotherapy

Review
of
the
literature
disclosed
no
previously
documented
similar
occurrence

Thirty-four
(
94
%
)
of
the
36
patients
enjoyed
sustained
moderate
or
marked
improvement
of
their
parkinsonian
symptoms
6
months
postoperatively

The
pallidal
radiofrequency
lesions
were
prolate
spheroid
shaped
and
were
composed
of
three
concentric
zones
in
the
early
postoperative
studies

Additional
edema
spreading
to
the
internal
capsule
was
noted
in
32
of
34
cases
and
to
the
optic
tract
in
11
of
34
cases

In
three
patients
no
lesion
was
identified
despite
sustained
clinical
improvement

The
lesion
was
located
in
the
posteroventral
GPi
in
all
cases
except
in
one
patient
in
whom
it
was
confined
to
the
GP
externus
(
GPe
)

This
49-year-old
woman
did
not
experience
sustained
benefit

The
authors
found
no
consistent
correlations
between
lesion
size
and
location
and
clinical
outcome
as
measured
by
a
global
outcome
score
,
the
Unified
Parkinson

Scale
motor
,
activities
of

,
and
bradykinesia
``

scores
or
rating
of
dyskinesias

OBJECTIVE
:
We
determined
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
neonatal
brain-stem
auditory
evoked
potentials
(
BAEP
)
as
markers
for
subsequent
hearing
impairment
and
for
developmental
problems
found
later
in
infancy
and
childhood

Behavioral
audiometry
was
repeated
during
periodic
follow-up
until
reliable
responses
were
obtained
for
all
frequencies
,
and
standardized
developmental
testing
was
also
conducted

Therefore
the
sensitivity
of
neonatal
BAEP
testing
for
predicting
subsequent
hearing
loss
was
only
42
%

In
contrast
,
on
language
development
testing
,
19
children
demonstrated
receptive
language
delay

Because
neonatal
ECMO
is
associated
with
a
high
risk
of
hearing
and
receptive
language
disorders
,
parents
should
be
counseled
that
audiologic
and
developmental
follow-up
evaluations
in
surviving
children
are
essential
regardless
of
the
results
of
neonatal
BAEP
testing

It
assumes
that
a
single
pathway
is
sufficient
for
educating
general
internists
and
subspecialty-bound
trainees

BACKGROUND
:
Darier
disease
is
an
uncommon
genodermatosis
characterized
by
the
symmetrical
eruption
of
keratotic
reddish-brown
papules
occurring
in
the
seborrheic
areas
of
the
body

A
unilateral
,
or
localized
,
variant
has
been
identified

The
implications
of
these
cases
on
future
genetic
studies
are
also
discussed

The
average
age
at
onset
was
27
years

This
condition
was
aggravated
by
sunlight
,
heat
,
or
sweating
in
42
%
(
19/40
)
of
reported
cases
,
and
38
%
(
15/40
)
of
the
patients
responded
to
treatment
with
topical
tretinoin

Further
studies
of
localized
Darier
disease
may
therefore
prove
to
be
instrumental
in
the
search
for
the
Darier
disease
gene

In
addition
,
we
are
able
to
generate
plants
in
which
only
CPDs
or
6-4
products
are
photoreactivated
in
the
nuclear
genome
by
exposing
these
mutants
to
UV
light
and
then
allowing
them
to
repair
one
or
the
other
class
of
dimers

Minimal
or
no
cutaneous
signs
were
present

Moreover
,
the
girl
had
no
antibodies
against
this
toxin

The
serum
cytokine
profile
during
the
acute
phase
of
her
illness
showed
high
levels
of
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
,
interleukin-6
and
interferon-gamma
,
as
is
seen
during
activation
of
the
immune
system
by
TSS
toxin
1

Other
possible
causes
for
the
patient
's
illness
were
excluded

It
is
possible
that
some
cases
of
syndrome
of
hemorrhagic
shock
and
encephalopathy
represent
a
variant
of
TSS
in
small
children

After
completion
of
chemotherapy
and
normalization
of
tumor
markers
,
both
patients
presented
with
pulmonary
symptoms
attributable
to
their
massively
enlarging
mediastinal
teratomas
.

The
chicken
calmodulin
I
(
CaMI
)
gene
has
been
isolated
and
characterized
on
the
level
of
cDNA
and
genomic
DNA

The
deduced
amino
acid
(
aa
)
sequence
is
identical
to
the
one
of
chicken
CaMII
which
consists
of
148
aa

The
CaMI
gene
contains
six
exons

Its
intron/exon
organization
is
identical
to
that
of
the
chicken
CaMII
and
the
CaMI
and
CaMIII
genes
of
rat
and
human

The
gene
is
transcribed
into
four
mRNAs
of
0.8
,
1.4
,
1.7
and
4.4
kb
as
determined
by
Northern
blot
analysis

When
revascularizations
were
included
,
there
was
a
significant
trend
toward
higher
frequencies
of
events
with
increasing
calcium
quantity
(
P
&
#
60
;
.01
)

However
,
coronary
death
and
infarction
were
not
significantly
more
frequent
in
higher
quartiles

CONCLUSIONS
:
Calcium
quantities
from
the
3-mm
and
the
more
reproducible
6-mm
scanning
are
equally
accurate
for
predicting
events

Research
into
sexual
orientation-simplistically
referred
to
as
``
gay
gene
''
research-is
an
example
of
research
that
provokes
intense
controversy

Many
homosexual
people
have
been
forced
to
undergo
``
treatments
''
to
change
their
sexual
orientation

But
there
are
other
reasons
to
worry
about
such
research

The
efficiency
of
testicular
sperm
retrieval
by
testicular
fine
needle
aspiration
(
TEFNA
)
was
compared
with
open
biopsy
and
testicular
sperm
extraction
(
TESE
)
,
in
37
rigorously
selected
patients
with
non-obstructive
azoospermia

The
mean
age
of
the
male
patients
was
32.7
years
(
range
24-47
)

The
negative
predictive
value
of
high
serum
follicle
stimulating
hormone
(
FSH
)
concentrations
(
>
or
=10
IU/l
)
(
predicting
failure
to
find
spermatozoa
for
ICSI
)
was
low
(
38.4
%
)

The
positive
predictive
value
(
predicting
the
chance
to
find
spermatozoa
for
ICSI
)
of
normal-sized
testicle
was
not
different
from
that
of
small-sized
(
&
#
60
;
15
ml
)
testicle
(
50
%
)

Complications
included
one
case
of
testicular
bleeding
following
fine
needle
aspiration
,
treated
locally
,
and
two
cases
of
extratunical
haematomata
following
TESE
requiring
no
intervention

<
TO_SEE
>
In
patients
with
non-obstructive
azoospermia
,
TEFNA
has
a
significantly
lower
yield
compared
to
TESE

The
implantation
and
pregnancy
rates
per
embryo
transfer
were
13
and
29
%
respectively

Neither
serum
FSH
values
nor
testicular
size
were
predictive
of
the
chances
to
find
spermatozoa
for
ICSI

Some
complications
may
occur
even
following
TEFNA

Recently
,
the
putative
BCL-1
proto-oncogene
turned
out
to
be
none
other
than
the
cyclin
D1
gene

Although
the
observed
break
points
in
the
BCL-1

,
its
rearrangement
has
been
documented
in
40-70
%
of
cases
of
mantle

lymphoma
,
whereas
it
only
rarely
occurs
in
other
B

lymphomas

In

The
embryonic
development
of
the
face
has
been
studied
in
many
reviews
,
this
work
purposes
only
to
clear
up
some
points
which
remain
obscure
concerning
cervico-facial
morphogenesis

In
the
first
part
of
this
study
only
the
facial
development
,
properly
speaking
,
is
considered
,
although
it
can
not
be
separate
of
cervical
development
to
which
a
second
study
will
be
reserved

Then
we
approach
among
other
things
the
way
to
consider
the
maxillary
process
with
regard
to
the
other
facial
processes

A
case-control
study
was
performed
in
eight
pairs
of
women
to
determine
whether
preeclamptic
women
developed
abnormalities
in
minor
hemoglobins
,
glycolytic
enzymes
,
or
other
blood
components
that
might
provide
insight
into
the
pathophysiology
of
preeclampsia
,
or
that
in
combination
might
be
used
as
a
marker
for
the
condition

These
variables
and
standard
clinical
tests
were
analyzed
as
discriminators
between
preeclamptic
and
control
women

The
subjects
were
matched
for
age
,
ethnicity
,
parity
,
and
gestational
age

Variables
differing
significantly
between
groups
included
increases
in
uric
acid
(
UA
)
,
low-density
lipoproteins
(
LDL
)
,
phosphoglycerate
kinase
(
PGK
)
,
and
mean
platelet
volume
(
MPV
)
,
and
decreases
in
glyceraldehyde
phosphate
dehydrogenase
(
G3PD
)
in
preeclamptic
women
compared
to
normal
controls

Discriminant
analysis
revealed
the
following
function
to
separate
the
groups
:
0.7764
(
UA
)
+
0.8086
(
PGK
)
-0.7032
(
G3PD
)
+
0.1399
(
LDL
)
-0.2386
(
MPV
)

The
results
are
consistent
with
perturbations
in
red
cell
glycolysis
in
preeclampsia

Mouse
monoclonal
antibodies
specific
for
thiabendazole
(
a
post-harvest
fungicide
and
veterinary
anthelmintic
)
were
covalently
linked
through
free
amine
groups
to
aminosilanized
silicon
dioxide
films
using
glutaraldehyde

Immobilized
antibody
layers
were
stabilized
with
sucrose
,
dehydrated
,
and
stored
refrigerated
with
desiccant

Exposed
regions
of
immobilized
antibody
were
then
removed
by
exposure
to
a
low
power
,
radio
frequency
oxygen
discharge

Challenge
with
enzyme
linked
antigen
of
oxygen
plasma
exposed
antibody
layers
demonstrated
that
plasma
treatment
completely
neutralized
antibody
capture
ability

Ellipsometry
measurements
of
oxygen
plasma
exposed
antibody
layers
indicated
complete
removal
of
immobilized
antibodies

Fluorescent
imaging
demonstrated
smallest
line
widths
of
2-3
microns

A
key
feature
is
that
these
immune
cells
can
be
selectively
engineered
to
recognize
specific
antigens
in
vitro

We
have
previously
determined
that
mast
cell
metabolic
responses
can
be
thermally
transduced
in
real
time
,
thus
indicating
the
possibility
of
whole
cell
thermoelectric
immunobiosensing

The
method
is
based
on
an
evanescent
wave
generated
from
a
tapered
configuration
of
decladded
optical
fibre
and
does
not
require
any
volumetric
measurement

Tapered
fibres
are
immobilized
with
the
purified
cell
surface
protein
of
L.
donovani
by
covalent
bonding

Fluorescent
intensity
from
the
fibre
has
been
shown
to
be
proportional
to
L.
donovani
specific
antibodies
present
in
the
test
sera

Direct
readings
can
be
obtained
after
signal
enhancement
through
a
photomultiplier
tube
within
5
min

The
system
,
when
tested
on
12
positive
sera
,
did
not
show
any
false
negative
result

The
four
structurally
different
intercalators
showed
significant
distinction
in
binding
kinetics
and
equilibrium
signals

The
accuracy
is
demonstrated
by
the
measurement
of
control
sera

Both
physiological
and
pathological
materials
correlate
well
with
the
declared
values

The
dry
stored
lactate
catheter
needs
about
10
min
for
hydration
and
is
characterized
by
response
times
t98
%
of
less
than
2
min

Often
,
the
binding
kinetics
may
be
described
by
a
single-fractal
analysis

It
is
of
interest
to
note
that
the
state
of
disorder
(
or
the
fractal
dimension
)
and
the
binding
rate
coefficient
both
increase
as
the
reaction
progresses
on
the
biosensor
surface

Also
,
the
magnitude
of
the
changes
in
the
binding
rate
coefficients
(
k1
and
k2
)
and
in
the
fractal
dimensions
(
Df1
and
Df2
)
as
different
parameters
are
changed
for
the
different
biosensor
applications
are
of
particular
value
,
since
they
provide
us
with
a
measure
or
extent
of
changes
in
the
binding
rate
coefficient
on
changing
different
experimental
parameter
values

It
is
of
interest
to
note
the
effect
of
different
parameters
on
the
extent
or
heterogeneity
that
exists
on
the
surface
and
how
this
influences
the
binding
rate
coefficients

If
no
microscopic
urinalysis
is
required
,
testing
turn-around
time
is
reduced
by
12.3
min/test
and
the
hospital
charge
is
reduced
from
U.S

In
all
simple
salines
,
irrespective
of
their
osmolarity
,
Lucifer
Yellow
CH
was
found
to
preferentially
migrate
in
the
posterior
direction
and
to
accumulate
in
the
oocyte
due
to
progressive
binding
to
yolk
spheres

Thus
,
with
this
sensitive
method
,
no
correlation
was
detectable
between
the
external
osmolarity
,
the
electrical
charge
and
the
preferential
direction
of
migration
of
a
microinjected
probe

The
AF-4
gene
on
human
chromosome
4q21
is
involved
in
reciprocal
translocations
to
the
ALL-1
gene
on
chromosome
11q23
,
which
are
associated
with
acute
lymphoblastic
leukaemias

A
set
of
recombinant
phage
carrying
genomic
fragments
for
the
coding
region
and
flanking
sequences
of
the
AF-4
gene
were
isolated

Phage
inserts
were
assembled
into
four
contigs
with
21
exons
,
and
an
intron
phase
map
was
produced
enabling
the
interpretation
of
translocation-generated
fusion
proteins

Polyclonal
antisera
directed
against
three
different
portions
of
the
AF-4
protein
were
produced
and
used
to
detect
a
116
kD
protein
in
cellular
extracts
of
human
B-lymphoblastoid
and
proB
cell
lines

Comparison
of
AF-4
protein
coding
sequences
with
the
LAF-4
and
FMR-2
sequences
revealed
five
highly
conserved
domains
of
potential
functional
relevance

In
the
present
study
,
we
report
the
molecular
cloning
of
three
isoforms
,
the
biochemical
analysis
and
the
immunohistochemical
characterization
of
one
of
the
proteins
identified
in
this
screen

We
identify
three
different
mRNA
forms
of
chLAMP
and
show
that
two
forms
with
distinct
5'-termini
are
differentially
transcribed
in
neural
development

Two
novel
cDNAs
,
DNAS1L2
and
DNAS1L3
,
are
predicted
to
encode
proteins
of
299
and
305
amino
acids
with
56
and
46
%
residue
identity
(
71
and
63
%
similarity
)
,
respectively
,
to
deoxyribonuclease
I
(
DNase
I
)

Northern
analysis
revealed
DNAS1L3
expression
nearly
exclusively
in
liver
,
while
DNAS1L2
expression
was
detected
in
brain
by
RT-PCR

Thus
,
to
date
,
four
DNase
I-like
genes
that
show
different
tissue
expression
patterns
are
known

In
the
second
group
,
a
rebound
in
virus
levels
in
plasma
followed
the
initial
sharp
decline
observed
at
the
start
of
therapy

This
was
associated
with
the
emergence
of
drug-resistant
variants

Sequence
analysis
of
the
protease
gene
during
the
course
of
therapy
revealed
that
in
this
second
group
there
was
a
sequential
acquisition
of
protease
mutations
at
amino
acids
46
,
82
,
54
,
71
,
89
,
and
90

Recombinant
HIV-1
variants
containing
two
or
three
mutations
in
the
protease
gene
were
constructed
either
with
mutations
at
the
p7/p1
cleavage
site
or
with
wild-type
(
WT
)
gag
sequences

Introduction
of
an
additional
mutation
at
the
gag
p7/p1
protease
cleavage
site
compensated
for
the
partially
defective
protease
gene

Optimal
rates
of
virus
replication
require
protease
cleavage
of
precursor
polyproteins

A
mutation
in
the
cleavage
site
that
enhanced
the
availability
of
a
protein
that
was
rate
limiting
for
virus
maturation
would
confer
on
that
virus
a
significant
growth
advantage
and
may
explain
the
uniform
emergence
of
viruses
with
alterations
at
the
p7/p1
cleavage
site

Activation
of
Raf-1
kinase
resulted
in
a
delayed
and
sustained
increase
of
HMGI-C
expression
in
the
Pa-4
cells

The
induction
of
HMGI-C
mRNA
level
is
sensitive
to
both
the
protein
synthesis
inhibitor
cycloheximide
and
transcription
inhibitor
actinomycin
D

The
predicted
protein
,
pendrin
,
is
closely
related
to
a
number
of
known
sulphate
transporters

The
procedure
involves
directed
microdissection
of
one
defined
subchromosomal
area
,
its
DOP-PCR-amplification
and
cloning

Linkage
analysis
assigned
six
of
them
to
their
predefined
subchromosomal
origin
on
BTA
6
corresponding
to
the
specific
rehybridization
signal
of
the
DOP-PCR
product
generated
from
the
microdissected
chromosome
area
6q21-31

The
lipophilic
character
of
dioxins
prevents
their
excretion
in
the
urine
and
causes
their
accumulation
in
body
fat

Recent
experimental
data
also
indicate
that
dioxins
can
cause
dysfunction
of
the
sexual
and
thyroid
hormone
systems
and
that
the
administration
of
dioxins
induces
several
conditions
related
to
hormonal
dysfunction

Chronic
exposure
of
female
Rhesus
monkeys
increases
the
incidence
and
severity
of
endometriosis

The
administration
of
dioxins
during
pregnancy
and
nursing
causes
altered
development
of
the
reproductive
system
,
decreased
spermatogenesis
,
hypothyroidism
and
disturbed
psychomotor
development
in
the
offspring

New
diagnostic
criteria
lowered
the
cut
off
value
to
126
mg/dl
,
in
order
to
detect
more
rapidly
diabetes
and
its
complications

These
last
drugs
seem
very
attractive
because
they
decrease
insulin
resistance
in
obese
,
diabetics

Their
hepatic
side
effects
must
be
however
under
control

Better
knowledge
of
non
lipidic
effects
of
statins
on
the
arterial
wall
and
the
discovery
of
the
action
of
fibrates
on
PPAR
(
Peroxisome
Proliferator
Activated
Receptors
)
improved
strongly
the
therapeutic
management
of
hyperlipidemias

However
,
these
results
have
to
be
confirmed
by
larger
trials
,
currently
underway
,
before
to
consider
that
beta-blockade
should
definitely
be
incorporated
in
the
treatment
of
heart
failure

Sumatriptan
and
other
selective
serotonin
agonists
represent
a
major
breakthrough
in
acute
migraine
treatment

A
single
training
bout
per
day
was
previously
considered
sufficient
,
whereas
today
athletes
regularly
train
twice
a
day
or
more

Consequently
,
the
number
of
athletes
who
are
overtraining
and
have
insufficient
rest
is
increasing

However
,
negative
overtraining
,
causing
maladaptation
and
other
negative
consequences
such
as
staleness
,
can
occur

Physiological
,
psychological
,
biochemical
and
immunological
symptoms
must
be
considered
,
both
independently
and
together
,
to
fully
understand
the
'staleness
'
syndrome

The
time
frame
of
training
and
recovery
is
also
important
since
the
consequences
of
negative
overtraining
comprise
an
overtraining-response
continuum
from
short
to
long
term
effects

For
an
elite
athlete
to
refrain
from
training
for
>
72
hours
is
extremely
undesirable
,
highlighting
the
importance
of
a
carefully
monitored
recovery
process

One
such
framework
for
this
is
referred
to
as
the
total
quality
recovery
(
TQR
)
process

By
using
a
TQR
scale
,
structured
around
the
scale
developed
for
ratings
of
perceived
exertion
(
RPE
)
,
the
recovery
process
can
be
monitored
and
matched
against
the
breakdown
(
training
)
process
(
TQR
versus
RPE
)

The
TQR
scale
emphasises
both
the
athlete
's
perception
of
recovery
and
the
importance
of
active
measures
to
improve
the
recovery
process

Little
attention
has
been
directed
toward
identifying
the
changes
which
occur
in
salivary
composition
in
response
to
exercise

A
knowledge
of
the
neural
control
of
salivary
secretion
is
especially
important
for
the
understanding
of
the
effects
of
exertion
on
salivary
secretion

Saliva
composition
might
therefore
be
used
as
an
alternative
noninvasive
indicator
of
the
response
of
the
different
body
tissues
and
systems
to
physical
exertion

In
this
respect
,
the
response
of
salivary
amylase
and
salivary
electrolytes
to
incremental
levels
of
exercise
is
of
particular
interest

Tsa
is
the
point
during
exercise
at
which
the
levels
of
salivary
alpha-amylase
and
electrolytes
(
especially
Na+
)
also
begin
to
rise
above
baseline
levels

It
has
been
determined
that
the
plasma
FFA
turnover
rate
is
sufficiently
rapid
to
account
for
most
of
the
fat
metabolised
during
low
intensity
exercise
(
25
to
40
%
VO2max
)

However
,
an
exercise
intensity
of
65
%
VO2max
results
in
a
slight
decrease
in
the
amount
of
plasma
FFA
uptake
by
muscle
tissue

Furthermore
,
it
is
widely
documented
that
endurance
activities
increase
the
energy
utilisation
from
fat
while
sparing
carbohydrate
sources

A
clinical
joint
study
on
insulin
therapy
,
a
survey
of
the
actual
inter-laboratory
differences
in
GHb
measurement
among
41
institutions
and
an
assessment
of
11
assay
methods
for
the
determination
of
GHb
were
performed
using
commercial
calibrators
and
fresh
blood
samples

The
recommendation
of
the
Japan
Diabetes
Society
to
measure
only
the
stable
GHb
component
and
to
correct
the
GHb
percentage
by
two-point
calibration
with
assigned
values
,
was
effective
but
not
sufficient

Users
in
clinical
practice
must
recognize
these
problems
,
and
,
before
supply
,
the
providers
should
check
their
method
and
keep
records
that
are
readily
traceable

A

1996

In
hospitals
where
venography
was
routinely
used
as

,
the
most
common
reasons
were
:
the
perceived
inferiority
of

in
demonstrating
below-knee

,
its
time-consuming

and
the

conclusions
:
the

:
An

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
From
1959
to

,
84
patients
underwent
a
total
of
90
operations
for
treatment
of
pulmonary
aspergilloma
in
the
Marie-Lannelongue
Hospital

The
lesion
was
resected
by
video-assisted
thoracoscopic

because
it
was
suspected
of
being
a
lung
abscess
that
had
caused
repeated

PURPOSE
:
Macrolide
antibiotics
are
frequently
prescribed
to
patients
with
symptoms
of
a
common
cold

Because
the
symptoms
of
rhinovirus
colds
are
attributed
to
the
inflammatory
response
to
infection
,
we
studied
the
effects
of
treatment
with
clarithromycin
on
the
symptomatic
and
inflammatory
response
to
nasal
inoculation
with
rhinovirus

Therapeutic

applied
with
the
same
success
in

and
as

as
co-amoxiclav
,

or
amoxycillin
in

Additionally
,
epidemiologic

clarithromycin

BACKGROUND
:
Drainage
methods
for
the
gastric
conduit
after
esophagectomy
for
carcinoma
have
been
controversial

Contemporary
asthma
management
guidelines
list
inhaled
corticosteroids
as
the
preferred

medication
for
patients
with
persistent
asthma

Fluticasone
propionate
is
one
of
several
inhaled
corticosteroids
used
for
the
treatment
of
asthma

Combination
therapy
with
interferon-alpha
(
IFN
alpha
)
plus
Ribavirin
has
been
shown
to
improve
the
response
rate
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
as
compared
to
IFN
alpha
alone

To
prove
,
whether
Ribavirin
has
any
additional
effect
on
the
decline
of
hepatitis
C
viremia
during
the
first
weeks
of
treatment
patients
with
and
without
combination
therapy
were
compared

Use
of

CONCLUSION
:
In
patients
with
asthma
receiving
repeated
inhaled
doses
of
FP
,
the
systemic
exposure
(
AUC
)
after
inhalation
from
the
Diskus
was
similar
to
that
from
the
Diskhaler
,
with
no
difference
between
the
DPIs
in
the
effects
on
cortisol
suppression

CONCLUSIONS
:
Amoxicillin
remains
the
antibiotic
of
choice
for
initial
empiric
treatment
of
AOM
,
although
the
traditional
dosage
should
be
increased
in
patients
at

CONCLUSIONS
:
Malnourished
patients
with
chronic
renal
failure
receiving
PN
are
at
risk
of
developing
electrolyte
abnormalities
,
particularly
hypophosphatemia

Aortocoronary
bypass
grafting
is
an
accepted
procedure
for
ischemic
heart
disease

Immunotherapy
of
mice
with
preexisting
cancers
with
heat
shock
protein
preparations
derived
from
autologous
cancer
resulted
in
retarded
progression
of
the
primary
cancer
,
a
reduced
metastatic
load
,
and
prolongation
of
life-span

Subcutaneous
injection
of
irradiated
LLC-IL2
did
not
affect
the
growth
of
preexisting
s.c.
tumors
and
also
did
not
improve
survival
of
mice
bearing
the
lung
or
peritoneal
tumors

We
describe
such
an
event
in
a
man
who
underwent
allogeneic
BMT
for
APL
in
second
relapse
and
4
years
later
presented
with
testicular
relapse

<
TO_SEE

CONCLUSION
:
Direct
PTA
may
be
performed
safely
as
an
alternative
to
thrombolytic
therapy
in
patients
with
acute
occlusion
of
the
middle
cerebral
artery
when
early
CT
findings
and/or
lenticulostriate
artery
involvement
are
present
or
when
superselective
local
angiography
shows
the
presence
of
a
large
embolus
or
high-grade
stenosis

Therefore
,
prudent
management
and
use
of
washed
red
blood
cells
transfusion
would
prevent
hemolytic
aggravation
even
in
open
heart
surgery

We
report
the
first
case
(
to
our
knowledge
)
of
an
endoscopic
removal
of
a
forehead
soft
tissue
mass

As
the
overview
shows
,
both
groups
of
substances
are
useful
for
individualized
treatment
of
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
,
provided
that
conservative
pharmacological
treatment
of
BPH
is
basically
accepted
and
that
the
patients
'
quality
of
life
is
also
considered

Besides
the
well-known
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs
(
NSAID
)
for
the
treatment
of
rheumatic
pain
herbal
medicine
can
also
be
applied
successfully

High-dose
intravenous
immunoglobulin
(
hdIVIg
)
is
increasingly
used
to
treat
a
range
of
inflammatory
and
autoimmune
diseases

We
describe
a
technique
that
enables
the
autologous
repair
of
large
midline
incisional
hernias
by
restoring
the
functional
musculoaponeurotic
support
of
the
abdominal
wall

METHODS
:
During
a
19-month
period
,
seven
children
with
empyema
underwent
thoracoscopy

While
these
findings
are
observed
for
all
classes
of
oral
drugs
,
the
issue
is
especially
critical
for
cancer
chemotherapy
,
in
which
a
narrow
therapeutic
index
is
frequently
observed

Therefore
,
interest
is
growing
in
mAbs
as
therapeutic
alternatives
for
patients
with
low-grade
NHL
and
those
with
transformed
histology

The
activity
of
oral
UFT
in
large-bowel
cancer
when
administered
with
oral
LV
(
approximately
50
mg/dose
)
has
resulted
in
objective
response
rates
of
approximately
40
%

CONCLUSION
:
UFT
is
a
fluoropyrimidine
active
in
colorectal
cancer

BACKGROUND
:
Adrenalectomy
is
the
current
treatment
for
phaeochromocytoma

As
single
agent
therapy
in
malignant
melanoma
,
interferon
alfa-2a
was
only
marginally
useful
in
most
patients

Studies
with
various
interferon
alpha
preparations
,
including
interferons
induced
in
human
leukocytes
,
interferon
alfa-N1
,
interferon
alfa-2a
,
and
interferon
alfa-2b
,
have
all
provided
evidence
for
modest
but
reproducible
antitumor
activity
in
advanced
renal
cell
carcinoma

The
rationale
for
antileukemic
therapy
in
hairy
cell
leukemia
is
to
reduce
the
significant
risk
of
infection
and
other
potential
serious
complications

Recombinant
and
natural
forms
of
interferon
alpha
have
been
shown
to
bring
about
tumor

lymphoma

Current
studies
using
interferon
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphomas
are
evaluating
lower
,
and
perhaps
better
tolerated
doses
of
interferon

While
the
demonstrated
antiviral
,
antiproliferative
,
and
immunomodulatory
properties
of
interferons
have
led
to
a
number
of
theories
regarding
their
potential
use
in
treating
individuals
with
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
(
CML
)
,
their
limited
availability
has
prevented
thorough
clinical
investigation
