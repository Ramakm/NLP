23
weeks
at
the
University
of
Vermont
in
1995
(
n
=
2395
)
were
retrospectively
analyzed
for
delivery
route
,
indication
for
cesarean
,
gestational
age
,
parity
,
and
practice
group
(
to
reflect
risk
status
)

The
total
cesarean
rate
was
14.4
%
(
344
of
2395
)
,
and
the
primary
rate
was
11.4
%
(
244
of
2144
)

Abnormal
presentation
was
the
most
common
indication
(
25.6
%
,
88
of
344
)

The
``
corrected
''
cesarean
rate
(
maternal-fetal
medicine
and
transported
patients
excluded
)
was
12.4
%
(
273
of
2194
)
,
and
the
``
corrected
''
primary
rate
was
9.6
%
(
190
of
1975
)

Arrest
of
dilation
was
the
most
common
indication
in
both
``
corrected
''
subgroups
(
23.4
and
24.6
%
,
respectively
)

Cesarean
rates
at
tertiary
care
hospitals
should
be
compared
with
rates
at
community
hospitals
only
after
correcting
for
dissimilar
patient
groups
or
gestational
age

In
the
third
trimester
,
the
amniotic
fluid
index
(
AFI
)
may
be
affected
by
maternal
fluid
status

We
hypothesize
that
as
temperature
increases
there
would
be
a
concomitant
decrease
in
AFI

From
June
11
to
August
16
,
1993
,
during
a
period
of
unusual
high
heat
,
42
women
with
singleton
pregnancies
between
27
and
40
weeks
'
gestation
undergoing
serial
antenatal
testing
had
AFI
determinations
recorded
at
least
weekly

The
daily
high
ambient
temperature
in
our
urban
area
was
subsequently
obtained

A
2-
,
3-
,
and
4-day
mean
temperature
prior
to
the
test
date
was
compared
to
AFI
using
a
Spearman-rank
Correlation

This
relationship
should
be
taken
into
account
when
interpreting
the
AFI
as
a
measure
of
fetal
well-being

The
study
population
included
84
women
with
gestational
diabetes
,
ascertained
by
universal
screening
of
all
women
attending
the
antenatal
clinic
of
the
Hadassah
Medical
Center
,
over
a
2-year
period

The
60
women
(
71
%
)
,
who
initiated
treatment
before
34
completed
weeks
,
composed
the
``
early
''
group

The
24
women
(
29
%
)
,
who
initiated
treatment
after
the
34th
week
,
composed
the
``
late
''
group

All
patients
were
managed
by
an
intensified
protocol
,
including
stringent
glycemic
control

Maternal
characteristics
were
similar
in
the
two
groups

No
significant
differences
were
found
between
the
two
groups
in
the
mode
of
delivery
or
Apgar
scores

We
conclude
that
to
reduce
the
rate
of
macrosomic
infants
in
gestational
diabetes
cases
,
good
glycemic
control
should
be
initiated
before
34
completed
gestational
weeks

Our
aim
was
to
investigate
the
contribution
of
certain
antenatally
detectable
markers
leading
to
the
diagnosis
of
trisomic
fetuses
we
observed
over
a
period
of
6
years

Down
syndrome
(
12
cases
)
and
Edward
syndrome
(
11
cases
)
were
the
most
common
trisomies
,
while
4
cases
of
Patau
syndrome
were
also
diagnosed

Down
syndrome
fetuses
(
41.7
%
)
had
prenatally
detected
sonographic
anomalies
,
63.6
%
for
Edward
syndrome
,
and
all
fetuses
with
Patau
syndrome
(
4
of
4
)
showed
abnormal
sonographic
signs

Trisomy
21
presented
with
the
following
features
:
hydramnios
,
complex
malformations
,
pyelectasis
,
and
duodenal
atresia

Signs
observed
in
fetuses
with
trisomy
13
were
:
hydrocephalus
,
intrauterine
growth
retardation
,
oligoanhydramnios
,
complex
malformations
,
severe
fetal
bradycardia
and
hydronephrosis

Fifty-three
triplet
pregnancies
between
1986
and
1993
at
The
New
York
Hospital-Cornell
Medical
Center
were
reviewed

Severe
preeclampsia
was
defined
by
standard
criteria

Student
's
t-test
,
Fisher
exact
test
,
and
Chi-square
were
used
for
statistical
analysis

The
rate
of
overall
preeclampsia
was
not
significantly
different
in
the
triplet
18
of
53
(
33.96
%
)
or
twin
12
of
53
(
22.6
%
)
groups

In
this
retrospective
,
case-controlled
study
,
the
rate
of
severe
pre-eclampsia
was
significantly
increased
in
triplet
gestations
as
compared
to
twins
although
the
overall
rate
of
preeclampsia
was
not

This
information
may
be
useful
in
counseling
patients
with
high
order
multifetal
gestations

The
survey
indicated
a
variety
of
thermal
care
styles

Two
NICUs
preferred
to
admit
infants
to
incubators
,
the
other
three
favoring
radiant
warmers

These
three
NICUs
moved
infants
from
radiant
warmers
into
incubators
at
significantly
different
mean
ages

The
audit
demonstrated
inconsistent
use
of
plastic
covers
,
warming
mattresses
,
and
added
humidity
under
radiant
warmers
,
and
discrepancies
between
survey
responses
and
actual
use
within
NICUs

Inter-NICU
variability
of
thermal
equipment
use
may
complicate
fluid
management

This
report
describes
a
full-term
newborn
with
massive
fetomaternal
hemorrhage

Fetal
movements
were
decreased
48
hr
prior
to
delivery

On
the
day
of
delivery
,
they
were
absent

The
nonstress
test
was
abnormal
with
low
biophysical
profile
and
decreased
beat-to-beat
variability

Omphalocele-Exstrophy-Imperforate
anus-Spinal
defects
(
OEIS
complex
)
,
a
combination
of
omphalocele
,
exstrophy
of
the
bladder
,
an
imperforate
anus
and
spinal
defects
,
arises
from
a
single
localized
defect
in
the
early
development
of
the
mesoderm
that
will
later
contribute
to
infraumbilical
mesenchyme
,
cloacal
septum
,
and
caudal
vertebrae

In
this
report
,
we
document
the
perinatal
features
of
two
cases
of
OEIS
complex
associated
with
meningomyeloceles
and
severe
lower
limb
defects
,
and
discuss
the
prenatal
diagnosis
,
inheritance
,
and
differential
diagnosis
of
this
association
of
malformations

Although
long-term
survival
can
be
achieved
by
successful
corrective
surgery
,
the
associated
structural
defects
such
as
large
meningomyelocele
and
severe
limb
aplasia
or
hypoplasia
,
as
seen
in
our
patient
,
can
influence
the
patient
's
quality
of
life
.

We
would
like
to
emphasize
that
an
accurate
prenatal
diagnosis
of
OEIS
complex
and
associated
malformations
is
important
for
the
detailed
counseling
of
the
family
as
well
as
appropriate
perinatal
management
by
the
obstetricians
,
pediatric
surgeons
,
urologists
,
neurosurgeons
,
and
neonatologists

Nonimmune
hydrops
fetails
diagnosed
at
21
weeks

profound
ascites
,

,
and
pericardial
effusion
receded
gradually
with
regression
of
a
subchorial
placental
lucencies
immediately
below
the
umbilical
cord
insertion

Careful
inspection
of
the
delivered
placenta
revealed
that
there
was
a
yellowish
lesion
of
fibrin
deposits
below
the
cord
insertion
site
,
which
resulted
from
the
absorption
of
hematoma

The
mitochondrial
diseases
are
uncommon
multisystem
disorders
characterized
by
the
presence
of
functionally
and/or
structurally
abnormal
mitochondria

As
there
have
been
few
reports
of
the
obstetrical
care
of
affected
patients
,
we
wish
to
document
two
pregnancies
in
a
woman
with
a
Chronic
Progressive
External
Ophthalmoplegia
(
Kearns-Sayre-like
syndrome
)

Both
pregnancies
were
complicated
by
preterm
labor
and
hypertension

CONTEXT
:
Four
genetic
loci
have
been
identified
as
contributing
to
Alzheimer
disease
(
AD
)
,
including
the
amyloid
precursor
protein
gene
,
the
presenilin
1
gene
,
the
presenilin
2
gene
,
and
the
apolipoprotein
E
gene
,
but
do
not
account
for
all
the
genetic
risk
for
AD

OBJECTIVE
:
To
identify
additional
genetic
risk
factors
for
late-onset
AD

DESIGN
:
A
complete
genomic
screen
was
performed
(
N=280
markers
)

Critical
values
for
chromosomal
regional
follow-up
were
a
P

,
a

obtained
,
a
subset
of
16
families
(
135
total

members
,
52
of
whom
were
patients
with
AD
)
was
used
for
the
genomic

subset
of
38
families
(
216
total
family
members
,
89
of
whom
were
patients
with
AD
)
was
used
for
the
follow-up
analysis

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Linkage
analysis
results
generated
using
both
genetic
model-dependent
(
lod
score
)
and
model-independent
methods

RESULTS
:
Fifteen
chromosomal
regions
warranted

Follow-up
analyses
revealed
4
regions
of
continued

on
chromosomes
4
,

,
12
,
and

,
with
the
strongest

Analysis
of
these

2.4
,
3.7
,
and
3.3
and
a

Additional
analyses
are
necessary
to
identify

and
to
follow
up
the
regions

However
,
knowledge
regarding
all
possible
mutations
and
the
relationship
between
risk
factors
and
mutations
is
incomplete

OBJECTIVES
:
To
identify
BRCA1
mutations
and
to
determine
factors
that
best
predict
presence
of
a
deleterious
BRCA1
mutation
in
patients
with
breast
and/or
ovarian
cancer

No
participant
was
from
a
family
in
which
genetic
markers
showed
linkage
to
the
BRCA1
locus

MAJOR
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Sequence
variants
detected
in
this
sample
are
presented
along
with
analyses
designed
to
determine
predictive
characteristics
of
those
testing
positive
for
BRCA1
mutations

Fifty
new
genetic
alterations
were
found
including
24
deleterious
mutations
,
24
variants
of
unknown
significance
,
and
2
rare
polymorphisms

A
bias
in
prior
reports
for
mutations
in
exon
11
was
revealed

Characteristics
of
a
patient
's
specific
diagnosis
(
unilateral
or
bilateral
breast
cancer
,
with
or
without
ovarian
cancer
)
,
early
age
at
diagnosis
,
Ashkenazi
Jewish
ethnicity
,
and
family
history
of
cancer
were
positively
associated
with
the
probability
of
her
carrying
a
deleterious
BRCA1
mutation

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
phenotypic
characteristics
of
families
potentially
linked
to
the
hereditary
prostate
cancer
1
(
HPC1
)
locus
on
chromosome
1q24-25

Prostate
cancer
cases
from
the
National
Cancer
Data
Base
were
used
as
a
reference
population
for
comparison

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
The
families
were
divided
into
2
groups
:
either
potentially
linked
(
33
families
with
133
men
with
prostate
cancer
)
,
and
thus
likely
to
be
carrying
an
altered
HPC1
gene
,
or
potentially
unlinked
(
41
families
with
172
men
with
prostate
cancer
)
,
on
the
basis
of
haplotype
analysis
in
the
region
of
HPC1

The
age
at
diagnosis
of
prostate
cancer
,
serum
prostate-specific
antigen
levels
,
digital
rectal
examination
status
,
stage
,
grade
,
primary
treatment
of
prostate
cancers
,
and
occurrence
of
other
cancers
were
compared
between
the
groups

RESULTS
:
The
mean
age
at
diagnosis
of
prostate
cancer
for
men
in
potentially
linked
families
was
significantly
lower
than
for
men
in
potentially
unlinked
families
(
63.7
vs
65.9
years
,
respectively
,
P=.01
;
mean
age
at
diagnosis
in
the
reference
population
was
71.6
years
)

Higher-grade
cancers
(
grade
3
)
were
more
common
in
potentially
linked
families
,
and
advanced-stage
disease
was
found
in
41
%
of
the
case
patients
in
potentially
linked
families
compared
with
31
%
in
both
the
potentially
unlinked
families
and
the
reference
groups
(
P=.03
for
the
latter
comparison
)

In
the
other
clinical
parameters
,
we
found
no
significant
differences
between
the
groups

A
modest
excess
of
breast
cancer
and
colon
cancer
was
found
in
potentially
linked
families
in
comparison
with
potentially
unlinked
families
,
but
this
difference
was
not
statistically
significant

However
,
3
characteristics
were
observed
:
younger
age
at
diagnosis
,
higher-grade
tumors
,
and
more
advanced-stage
disease

Our
study
shows
that
a
significant
fraction
of
hereditary
prostate
cancers
are
diagnosed
in
advanced
stages
,
emphasizing
the
clinical
importance
of
early
detection
in
men
potentially
carrying
prostate
cancer
susceptibility
genes

These
findings
support
the
current
recommendations
to
screen
men
with
a
positive
family
history
of
prostate
cancer
beginning
at
age
40
years

CONTEXT
:
Susceptibility
to
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS
)
involves
a
genetically
complex
autoimmune
component

The
3
regions
include
HLA
on
chromosome
6p21.3
,
APOE
on
chromosome
19ql
3.2
,
and
MBP
(
myelin
basic

18q23

SUBJECTS
:
A
total
of
120
Caucasian
patients
with
MS
and
107
unrelated
control
individuals
from
California
,
and
32
patients
and
32
unrelated
control
individuals
from
Beijing
,
China

All
patients
with
MS
were
diagnosed
as
having
clinically
definite

according
to
published
criteria

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Chi2
Testing
of
loci
and
individual
alleles
and
haplotypes

Haplotype
frequencies
were
estimated
with
standard
maximum
likelihood
methods

RESULTS
:
The
HLA
effect
is
due
to
the
class
II
DR2
haplotype
,
DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DRB1*0602
;
contributions
to
MS
susceptibility
from
additional
DRB1-DQB1
alleles
or
other
HLA
region
loci
were
not
observed

The
distribution
of
haplotypes
from
5
loci
within
the

19q13.2
region
,
including
D19S178
,
D19S574
,
APOE
,
APOC2
,
and
D19S219
,
differed
between
patient
and
control
samples

The
APOE
variation
,
prominent
in
other
neurological
diseases
,
showed
no
influence
on
MS
susceptibility
,
despite
its
location
within
the

OBJECTIVE
:
To
examine
long-term
risk
of
new
primary
cancers
in
survivors
of
childhood
retinoblastoma
and
quantify
the
role
of
radiotherapy
in
sarcoma
development

DESIGN
:
Cohort
incidence
study
of
patients
with
retinoblastoma
followed
for
a
median
of
20
years
,
and
nested
case-control
study
of
a
radiation
dose-response
relationship
for
bone
and
soft
tissue
sarcomas

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS
:
A
total
of
1604
patients
with
retinoblastoma
who
survived
at
least
1
year
after
diagnosis
,
identified
from
hospital
records
in
Massachusetts
and
New
York
during
1914
to
1984

RESULTS
:
Incidence
of
subsequent
cancers
was
statistically
significantly
elevated
only
in
the
961
patients
with
hereditary
retinoblastoma
,
in
whom
190
cancers
were
diagnosed
,
vs
6.3
expected
in
the
general
population
(

,
26-47
)
)

Cumulative
incidence
(
+/-SE
)
of
a
second
cancer
at
50
years
after
diagnosis
was
51.0
%
(
+/-6.2
%
)
for
hereditary
retinoblastoma
,
and
5.0
%
(
+/-3.0
%
)
for
nonhereditary

All
114
sarcomas
of
diverse
histologic
types
occurred
in
patients
with
hereditary
retinoblastoma

For
soft

sarcomas
,
the
RRs
showed
a
stepwise
increase
at
all

CONCLUSIONS
:
Genetic
predisposition
has
a
substantial
impact
on
risk
of
subsequent
cancers
in
retinoblastoma
patients
,
which
is
further
increased
by
radiation
treatment

A
radiation
dose-response
relationship
is
demonstrated
for
all
sarcomas
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
humans
,
for
soft
tissue
sarcomas

Retinoblastoma
patients
should
be
examined
for
new
cancers
and
followed
into
later
life
to
determine
whether
their
extraordinary
cancer
risk
extends
to
common
cancers
of
adulthood

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
rate
of
recent
cocaine
use
among
a
metropolitan
population
of
predominantly
Hispanic
and
African-American
women
with
preterm
premature
rupture
of
the
membranes
(
PROM
)
and
to
ascertain
the
impact
of
cocaine
on
the
latency
period
between
rupture
of
membranes
and
delivery

Urine
toxicology
screens
were
prospectively
obtained
on
147
women
with
preterm
PROM

All
women
were
expectantly
managed
without
tocolytics
until
37
weeks
'
gestation
unless
they
developed
clinical
chorioamnionitis
,
or
nonreassuring
fetal
heart
rate
tracing
or
biophysical
profile

The
rate
of
positive
urine
drug
screens
for
cocaine
was
8.2
%

There
was
a
higher
rate
of
recent
cocaine
use
among
African-American
women
(
20.4
%
)
as
compared
to
non-African-Americans
(
1.2
%
,
p
=
0.0001
)

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
reason
for
delivery
between
the
two
groups
of
patients

Recent
cocaine
use
among
women
with
preterm
PROM
is
common
in
only
some
segments
of
an
urban
population

Women
with
recent
cocaine
use
present
with
ruptured
membranes
at
an
earlier
gestational
age
and
may
actually
have
a
longer
latency
period
than
women
who
do
not
use
cocaine

Responses
to
an
interview
at
initial
prenatal
care
enrollment
were
compared
using
Chi-square
and
Fisher
's
exact
tests

Of
75
women
,
drug
users
(
51
%
)
were
more
likely
to
say
that
they
would
defer
initiating
prenatal
care
(
P
=
0.03
)
and
to
minimize
the
risk
of
drug
or
alcohol
use
to
the
fetus
(
P
=
0.04
)

Most
(
85
%
)
viewed
pregnancy
as
inappropriate
for
HIV
infected
women
and
primarily
drug
users
(
P
=
0.06
)
would
abort
if
HIV
infected

Over
half
thought
HIV
transmission
occurred
most
times
or
always

Only
20
%
had
heard
of
a
drug
to
reduce
this
risk
,
but
95
%
would
take
such
a
therapy

These
inner-city
,
pregnant
women
disapproved
of
pregnancy
if
HIV
infected
and
thought
the
risk
of
transmission
was
high

They
knew
little
of
how
to
reduce
this
risk
but
nearly
all
would
accept
a
drug
to
prevent
transmission

The
association
of
parvovirus
B19
infection
and
hydrops
fetalis
is
well
known

We
present
five
cases
of
isolated
pleural
or
pericardial
effusion
with
documented
maternal
parvovirus
infection
in
four
of
these
pregnancies

BACKGROUND
:
Cochlear
implantation
is
nowadays
a
reliable
and
well-accepted
method
of
auditory
rehabilitation
in
selected
adults
and
children

METHODS
:
We
present
rehabilitation
data
on
21
adult
patients
provided
with
the
Nucleus
CI22
M
cochlear
implant
using
the
SPEAK
strategy

RESULTS
:
Results
of
first
tune-up
show
an
open
set
speech
understanding
in
approximately
50
%
of
patients

Long-term
results
also
reveal
further
improvement
in
patients
who
had
no
open
set
speech
understanding

Our
data
seem
to
indicate
similar
results
in
comparison
to
other
groups
using
the
CIS
strategy

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
adults
,
open
set
speech
understanding
can
be
achieved
even
at
the
first
tune-up

Adverse
drug
effects
are
manifold
and
heterogenous

Many
situations
may
hamper
the
signalling
(
i.e
.
the
detection
of
early
warning
signs
)
of
adverse
effects
and
new
signals
often
differ
from
previous
experiences

Different
categories
of
adverse
effects
need
different
methods
for
detection

Current
pharmacovigilance
is
predominantly
based
on
spontaneous
reporting
and
is
mainly
helpful
in
detecting
type
B
effects
(
those
effects
that
are
often
allergic
or
idiosyncratic
reactions
,
characteristically
occurring
in
only
a
minority
of
patients
and
usually
unrelated
to
dosage
and
that
are
serious
,
unexpected
and
unpredictable
)
and
unusual
type
A
effects
(
those
effects
that
are
related
to
the
pharmacological
effects
of
the
drug
and
are
dosage-related
)

Examples
of
other
sources
of
signals
are
prescription
event
monitoring
,
large
automated
data
resources
on
morbidity
and
drug
use
(
including
record
linkage
)
,
case-control
surveillance
and
follow-up
studies

A
proposal
is
made
for
a
standard
signal
management
procedure
at
pharmacovigilance
centres
,
including
the
following
steps
:
signal
delineation
,
literature
search
,
preliminary
inventory
of
data
,
collection
of
additional
information
,
consultation
with
the
World
Health
Organization
Centre
for
International
Drug
Monitoring
and
the
relevant
drug
companies
,
aggregated
data
assessment
and
a
report
in
writing

A
better
understanding
of
the
conditions
and
mechanisms
involved
in
the
detection
of
adverse
drug
effects
may
further
improve
strategies
for
pharmacovigilance

OBJECTIVE
:
To
study
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
methylphenidate
in
children
with
the
dual
diagnosis
of
epilepsy
and
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(
ADHD
)

STUDY
DESIGN
:
Thirty
children
,
aged
6.4
to
16.4
years
,
with
epilepsy
and
ADHD
were
studied
during
a
4-month
period

During
the
initial
2
months
of
the
study
,
the
children
were
treated
with
antiepileptic
drugs
(
AEDs
)
only
,
and
for
the
remaining
2
months
,
methylphenidate
was
added
at
a
morning
dose
of
0.3
mg/kg

They
underwent
neurologic
assessment
,
brain
computed
tomography
,
IQ
testing
,
and
assessment
with
the
Childhood
Behavior
Checklist
at
baseline
before
methylphenidate
therapy

Electroencephalography
,
AED
determinations
,
and
the
continuous-performance
task
(
CPT
)
test
were
done
at
baseline
and
after
2
months
of
methylphenidate
therapy

On
the
2
days
of
testing
,
the
child
received
AEDs
and
a
capsule
containing
either
placebo
or
methylphenidate

RESULTS
:
None
of
the
25
children
of
this
sample
who
were
seizure
free
had
attacks
while
taking
methylphenidate

Of
the
5
children
with
seizures
,
3
had
an
increase
in
attacks
,
whereas
the
other
2
showed
no
change
or
a
reduction

Methylphenidate
benefited
70
%
of
children
according
to
parental
report
;
methylphenidate
also
enhanced
performance
on
the
CPT

Side
effects
of
methylphenidate
were
mild
and
transient

Caution
is
warranted
for
those
still
having
seizures
while
receiving
AED
therapy

The
temporal
properties
of
semantic
and
phonological
processes
in
speech
production
were
investigated
in
a
new
experimental
paradigm
using
movement-related
brain
potentials

The
main
experimental
task
was
picture
naming

In
addition
,
a
2-choice
reaction
go/no-go
procedure
was
included
,
involving
a
semantic
and
a
phonological
categorization
of
the
picture
name

Lateralized
readiness
potentials
(
LRPs
)
were
derived
to
test
whether
semantic
and
phonological
information
activated
motor
processes
at
separate
moments
in
time

Varying
the
position
of
the
critical
phoneme
in
the
picture
name
did
not
affect
the
onset
of
the
LRP
but
rather
influenced
when
the
LRP
began
to
differ
on
go
and
no-go
trials
and
allowed
the
duration
of
phonological
encoding
of
a
word
to
be
estimated

The
sequential
replacement
of
the
four
tryptophan
residues
in
gramicidin
A
at
positions
15
,
13
,
11
,
and
9
with
glycine
showed
that
there
was
no
detectable
effect
at
position
15
but
increasing
heterogeneity
of
species
in
the
micelles
proceeding
toward
the
interior
of
the
micelle
at
position
9

The
replacement
of
tryptophan
at
positions
15
and
9
with
alanine
was
found
to
produce
more
species
heterogeneity
than
found
with
glycine
substitution
at
the
same
positions

With
the
Gly-11
,
Gly-13
,
and
Gly-15
analogs
,
the
increase
in
SDS
concentration
results
in
the
formation
of
a
single
species
;
however
,
for
the
Gly-9
,
Ala-9
,
and
Ala-15
analogs
,
heterogeneity
remains

Molecular
dynamics
in
torsion-angle
space
was
applied
to
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
structure
calculation
using
nuclear
Overhauser
effect-derived
distances
and
J-coupling-constant-derived
dihedral
angle
restraints

Compared
to
two
other
commonly
used
algorithms
,
molecular
dynamics
in
Cartesian
space
and
metric-matrix
geometry
combined
with
Cartesian
molecular
dynamics
,
the
method
shows
increased
computational
efficiency
and
success
rate
for
large
proteins
,
and
it
shows
a
dramatically
increased
radius
of
convergence
for
DNA

The
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
algorithm
starts
from
an
extended
strand
conformation
and
proceeds
in
four
stages
:
high-temperature
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
,
slow-cooling
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
,
Cartesian
molecular
dynamics
,
and
minimization

Tests
were
carried
out
using
experimental
NMR
data
for
protein
G
,
interleukin-8
,
villin
14T
,
and
a
12
base-pair
duplex
of
DNA
,
and
simulated
NMR
data
for
bovine
pancreatic
trypsin
inhibitor

For
villin
14T
,
a
monomer
consisting
of
126
residues
,
structure
determination
by
torsion-angle
molecular
dynamics
has
a
success
rate
of
85
%
,
a
more
than
twofold
improvement
over
other
methods

The
wavelet-transform
method
is
used
to
quantify
the
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
(
MRS
)
parameters
:
chemical
shift
,
apparent
relaxation
time
T2
,
resonance
amplitude
,
and
phase

Wavelet
transformation
is
a
time-frequency
representation
which
separates
each
component
from
the
FID
,
then
successively
quantifies
it
and
subtracts
it
from
the
raw
signal

Two
iterative
procedures
have
been
developed

The
results
indicate
that
the
wavelet-transform
method
can
provide
efficient
and
accurate
quantification
of
MRS
data

BACKGROUND
:
Antiplatelet
therapy
with
aspirin
and
systematic
anticoagulation
with
warfarin
reduce
cardiovascular
morbidity
and
mortality
after
myocardial
infarction
when
given
alone

In
the
Coumadin
Aspirin
Reinfarction
Study
(
CARS
)
,
we
aimed
to
find
out
whether
a
combination
of
low-dose
warfarin
and
low-dose
aspirin
would
give
superior
results
to
standard
aspirin
monotherapy
without
excessive
bleeding
risk

METHODS
:
We
used
a
randomised
double-blind
study
design

Patients
took
a
single
tablet
daily
,
and
attended
for
prothrombin
time
(
PT
)
measurements
at
weeks
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
6
,
and
12
,
and
then
every
3
months

Patients
were
followed
up
for
a
maximum
of
33
months
(
median
14
months
)

FINDINGS
:
The
primary
event
was
first
occurrence
of
reinfarction
,
non-fatal
ischaemic
stroke
,
or
cardiovascular
death

Primary
comparisons
were
done
with
all
follow-up
data

The
relative
risk
of
the
primary
event
for
the
160
mg
aspirin
group
compared
with
the
3
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin
group
was
0.95
(
0.81-1.12
,
p
=
0.57
)

For
the
3382
patients
assigned
3
mg
warfarin
with
80
mg
aspirin
,
the
INR
results
were
:
at
week
1
(
n
=
2985
)
median
1.51
(
IQR
1.23-2.13
)
;
at
week
4
(
n
=
2701
)
1.27
(
1.13-1.64
)
;
at
month
6
(
n
=
2145
)
1.19
(
1.08-1.44
)

INTERPRETATION
:
Low
,
fixed-dose
warfarin
(
1
mg
or
3
mg
)
combined
with
low-dose
aspirin
(
80
mg
)
in
patients
who
have
had
myocardial
infarction
does
not
provide
clinical
benefit
beyond
that
achievable
with
160
mg
aspirin
monotherapy

BACKGROUND
:
There
is
serological
evidence
for
an
association
between
Chlamydia
pneumoniae
and
coronary
heart
disease

We
investigated
the
hypothesis
that
an
antichlamydial
macrolide
antibiotic
,
roxithromycin
,
can
prevent
or
reduce
recurrent
major
ischaemic
events
in
patients
with
unstable
angina

Patients
were
randomly
assigned
either
roxithromycin
150
mg
orally
twice
a
day
(
n
=
102
)
or
placebo
orally
twice
a
day
(
n
=
100
)

Patients
were
followed
up
for
6
months

We
report
the
primary
clinical
endpoints
(
cardiac
ischaemic
death
,
myocardial
infarction
,
and
severe
recurrent
ischaemia
)
,
assessed
at
day
31
,
in
202
patients
on
an
intention-to-treat
basis

FINDINGS
:
A
statistically
significant
reduction
in
the
primary
composite
triple
endpoint
rates
was
observed
in
the
roxithromycin
group
:
p
=
0.032

The
rate
of
severe
recurrent
ischaemia
,
myocardial
infarction
,
and
ischaemic
death
was
5.4
%
,
2.2
%
,
and
2.2
%
in
the
placebo
group
and
1.1
%
,
0
%
,
and
0
%
,
in
the
roxithromycin
group
,
respectively

No
major
drug-related
adverse
effects
were
observed

Large-scale
trials
are
needed
to
confirm
these
preliminary
observations

BACKGROUND
:
Stage
Ib
and
IIa
cervical
carcinoma
can
be
cured
by
radical
surgery
or
radiotherapy

These
two
procedures
are
equally
effective
,
but
differ
in
associated
morbidity
and
type
of
complications

In
this
prospective
randomised
trial
of
radiotherapy
versus
surgery
,
our
aim
was
to
assess
the
5-year
survival
and
the
rate
and
pattern
of
complications
and
recurrences
associated
with
each
treatment

METHODS
:
Between
September
,
1986
,
and
December
,
1991
,
469
women
with
newly
diagnosed
stage
Ib
and
IIa
cervical
carcinoma
were
referred
to
our
institute

Adjuvant
radiotherapy
was
delivered
after
surgery
for
women
with
surgical
stage
pT2b
or
greater
,
less
than
3
mm
of
safe
cervical
stroma
,
cut-through
,
or
positive
nodes

The
primary
outcome
measures
were
5-year
survival
and
the
rate
of
complications

The
analysis
of
survival
and
recurrence
was
by
intention
to
treat
and
analysis
of
complications
was
by
treatment
delivered

FINDINGS
:
170
patients
in
the
surgery
group
and
167
in
the
radiotherapy
group
were
included
in
the
intention-to-treat
analysis
;
scheduled
treatment
was
delivered
to
169
and
158
women
,
respectively
,
62
of
114
women
with
cervical
diameters
of
4
cm
or
smaller
and
46
of
55
with
diameters
larger
than
4
cm
received
adjuvant
therapy

After
a
median
follow-up
of
87
(
range
57-120
)
months
,
5-year
overall
and
disease-free
survival
were
identical
in
the
surgery
and
radiotherapy
groups
(
83
%
and
74
%
,
respectively
,
for
both
groups
)
,
86
women
developed
recurrent
disease
:
42
(
25
%
)
in
the
surgery
group
and
44
(
26
%
)
in
the
radiotherapy
group

Significant
factors
for
survival
in
univariate
and
multivariate
analyses
were
:
cervical
diameter
,
positive
lymphangiography
,
and
adeno-carcinomatous
histotype

48
(
28
%
)
surgery-group
patients
had
severe
morbidity
compared
with
19
(
12
%
)
radiotherapy-group
patients
(
p
=
0.0004
)

The
combination
of
surgery
and
radiotherapy
has
the
worst
morbidity
,
especially
urological
complications

The
optimum
therapy
for
each
patient
should
take
account
of
clinical
factors
such
as
menopausal
status
,
age
,
medical
illness
,
histological
type
,
and
cervical
diameter
to
yield
the
best
cure
with
minimum
complications

Today
's
technology
links
health
care
providers
and
patients
across
town
,
in
the
next
state
or
even
another
country

Nursing
across
state
lines
poses
complications
:
state-bound
regulatory
and
licensure
issues

Early
introduction
of
enteral
feeds
and
the
use
of
nutritional
modulation
are
emphasized

PROBLEM
:
To
compare
the
expression
by
T-lymphocytes
of
an
immunomodulatory
protein
known
as
progesterone-induced
blocking
factor
(
PIBF
)
in
conception
versus
non-conception
cycles
even
when
there
has
been
definite
fertilization
and
embryo
formation

METHOD
:
PIBF
expression
on
T
lymphocytes
was
measured
using
an
immunohistochemical
method
with
a
PIBF-specific
polyclonal
antibody

There
were
no
differences
in
PIBF
levels
by
therapy
used
in
non-pregnant
cases
or
in
the
pregnant
group

CONCLUSION
:
These
data
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
maternal
expression
of
PIBF
in
T-lymphocytes
soon
after
trophoblast
invasion
may
depend
on
successful
implantation

Many
amino
acids
contain
an
asymmetric
centre
,
occurring
as
laevorotatory
,
L
,
or
dextrorotatory
,
D
,
compounds

A
substantial
fraction
of
the
organic
compounds
on
the
early
Earth
may
have
been
derived
from
comet
and
meteorite
impacts

It
has
been
reported
previously
that
amino
acids
in
the
Murchison
meteorite
exhibit
an
excess
of
L-enantiomers
,
raising
the
possibility
that
a
similar
excess
was
present
in
the
initial
inventory
of
organic
compounds
on
the
Earth

The
stable
carbon
isotope
compositions
of
individual
amino
acids
in
Murchison
support
an
extraterrestrial
origin
--
rather
than
a
terrestrial
overprint
of
biological
amino
acids-although
reservations
have
persisted

A
proactive
preventive
approach
is
presented
that
suggests
strategies
to
use
during
the
previsit
phase
,
the
visit
experience
,
and
on
an
ongoing
basis

The
miracidia
of
Fasciola
hepatica
and
Trichobilharzia
ocellata
approach
their
host
snails
Lymnaea
truncatula
and
L.
stagnalis
by
increasing
their
rate
of
change
of
direction
(
RCD
)
in
increasing
gradients
of
snail-conditioned
water
(
SCW
)
,
and
they
perform
a
turnback
swimming
in
decreasing
gradients

Both
hostfinding
responses
in
both
species
were
induced
by
glycoconjugates
with
a
molecular
weight
of
>
30
kDa
that
were
sensitive
to
hydrolysis
with
pronase
E
and
oxidation
with
NaIO4

Alkaline
cleavage
revealed
that
they
contained
carbohydrates
linked
O-glycosidically
via
serine
and
N-acetylgalactosamine

Differences
in
the
chemical
characteristics
of
SCW
from
the
intermediate
hosts
L.
truncatula
and
L.
stagnalis
could
be
shown
by
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
,
blotting
,
and
subsequent
carbohydrate
detection

The
first
step
of
purification
of
the
effective
signaling
SCW
components
from
both
snail
species
was
achieved
by
ion-exchange
chromatography

Black
patients
with
colon
cancer
in
the
Black/White
Cancer
Survival
Study
were
found
to
have
a
poorer
survival
than
white
patients

More
advanced-stage
disease
at
diagnosis
was
the
primary
determinant
,
accounting
for
60
%
of
the
excess
mortality

Tumor
characteristics
of
703
cases
of
newly
diagnosed
invasive
colon
adenocarcinoma
were
centrally
evaluated
by
a
gastrointestinal
pathologist
,
blinded
in
regard
to
the
age
,
race
,
and
sex
of
the
patients

Blacks
were
less
likely
to
have
poorly
differentiated
(
grade
3
)
tumors
(
odds
ratio
(
OR
)
,
0.44
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
0.22-0.88
)
and
lymphoid
reaction
(
OR
,
0.49
;
95
%
confidence
interval
,
0.26-0.90
)
when
compared
with
whites

These
black/white
(
B/W
)
differences
remained
statistically
significant
after
adjusting
for
age
,
sex
,
metropolitan
area
,
summary
stage
,
socioeconomic
status
,
body
mass
index
,
and
health
care
access
and
utilization

In
addition
,
blacks
were
less
likely
to
have
high-grade
(
grade
3
)
nuclear
atypia
,
mitotic
activity
,
and
tubule
formation
,
although
these
ORs
did
not
reach
a
statistical
significance
level
of
0.05

Comparison
by
anatomical
subsite
showed
that
blacks
had
statistically
significantly
better
differentiated
tumors
for
cancers
of
the
proximal
and
transverse
colon
but
not
for
the
distal

No
racial
differences
were
found
for
blood
vessel
and
lymphatic
invasion
,
necrosis
,
fibrosis
,
and
mucinous
type
of
histology

The
findings
,
therefore
,
are
the
opposite
of
those
hypothesized

After
adjusting
for
stage
,
more
aggressive
tumor
characteristics
do
not
explain
the
adverse
survival
differential
in
blacks

This
suggests
that
there
may
be
racial
differences
in
environmental
exposure
,
and
that
the
intensity
and
mode
of
delivery
of
carcinogen
insult
as
well
as
host
susceptibility
may
differ
by
race
and
anatomical
subsite

Future
studies
should
explore
the
B/W
differences
in
tumor
biology
using
molecular
markers
that
precede
the
conventional
histological
parameters
evaluated
here

A
new
method
is
described
for
detection
of
mutations
in
the
lysosomal
alpha-glucosidase
gene
(
GAA
)
leading
to
Glycogen
Storage
Disease
type
II
(
GSDII
)

The
method
is
rapid
and
complementary
to
the
automated
sequencing
of
all
the
19
,
PCR
amplified
,
coding
exons
of
the
GAA
gene

A
new
splice
site
mutation
in
the
GAA
gene
of
this
patient
was
identified
,
IVS16
(
+2T
--
>
C
)
,
resulting
in
the
deletion
of
16
base
pairs
of
exon
16

The
presence
of
clinical
autonomic
dysfunction
in
patients
with
neurologic
diseases
,
such
as
multiple
sclerosis
,
Parkinson
's
disease
,
and
cerebrovascular
accident
,
has
become
increasingly
recognized
in
the
past
decade

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
autonomic
function
in
patients
with
cerebral
palsy
using
two
noninvasive
tests
:
sympathetic
skin
response
(
SSR
)
and
R-R
interval
variation
(
RRIV
)

No
significant
difference
in
frequency
of
absent
response
and
asymmetric
response
was
also
noted

Mean
heart
rate
under
relaxed
sitting
condition
was
significantly
higher
in
the
study
group

Significant
negative
correlation
between
heart
rate
and
age
was
noted
in
the
control
group
but
was
not
present
in
the
study
group

Also
,
there
was
no
statistical
difference
of
mean
RRIV
between
the
two
groups

No
objective
evidence
of
autonomic
disturbance
in
patients
with
cerebral
palsy
was
found
in
this
study

A
two-credits
per
semester
clinical
medicine
course
was
established
in
the
Department
of
Physical
Medicine
and
Rehabilitation
(
PM

;
R
)
in
cooperation
with
the
Johns

University
undergraduate
Human
Biology
faculty
to
present
the
variety
of
inpatient
consultation
personnel
,
units
,
patient
diagnostic
groups
,
and
functional
problems

The
curriculum
emphasizes
student
understanding
of
the
roles
of
rehabilitation
team
members

Objectives
include
demonstration
of
working
knowledge
of
the
Biopsychosocial
Model
,
the
World
Health
Organization
Model
of
disablement
and
interdisciplinary
rehabilitation
intervention

The
course
includes
simulations
of
physical
impairments
,
demonstrations
of
adaptive
equipment
,
interactive
chart
reviews
,
readings
,
and
audio
lectures

A
retrospective
sequential
review
was
made
of
the
last
100
physical
medicine
and
rehabilitation
consultations
with
student
attendance

The
results
confirm
student
exposure
to
many
ward
settings
(

and

)

This
process
develops
a
rudimentary
understanding
of
the
effect
of
illness
on
the
person
and
the
variety
of
medically
effective
therapeutic
modalities

This
study
is
designed
to
investigate
the
immediate
effectiveness
of
electrotherapy
on
myofascial
trigger
points
of
upper
trapezius
muscle

Sixty
patients
(
25
males
and
35
females
)
who
had
myofascial
trigger
points
in
one
side
of
the
upper
trapezius
muscles
were
studied

The
improvement
of
ROM
was
significantly
more
in
group
C
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.01
)
as
compared
with
that
in
group
A
or
group
B

EMS
could
significantly
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.05
)
improve
ROM
,
but
not
PT
,
better
than
the
placebo
groups
,
for
either
subgroup

Because
activity
and
regular
exercise
are
important
factors
to
maintain
general
good
health
in
senior
citizens
,
we
investigated
whether
senior
dancing
has
any
effect
on
peripheral
or
lumbar
bone
density

We
performed
a
prospective
study
over
a12-mo
period
on
bone
density
at
a
spinal
and
peripheral
measuring
site
in
28
female
senior
members
(
mean
age
:
67
+/-
2
yr
)
of
a
dancing
group
in
Vienna

Lumbar
bone
mineral
density
was
assessed
by
quantitative
computed
tomography
(
qCT
)
and
radial
bone
density
by
single
photon
absorptiometry
of
the
distal
forearm

Linear
regression
analysis
showed
that
the
lower
the
qCT
at
the
beginning
of
the
observation
period
,
the
higher
was
the
percentage
increase
of
spinal
qCT
in
the
entire
group
during
12
mo
of
dancing
(
r
=
0.52
,
P
&
#
60
;
0.0001
)

The
group
classified
as
dancers
with
osteoporosis
(
group
I
)
showed
a
significant
increase
in
lumbar
bone
density
,
whereas
in
the
group
of
dancers
without
signs
of
osteoporosis
(
group
II
)
,
BMD
remained
unchanged

Additionally
,
radial
bone
density
did
not
show
any
changes
in
either
group

Group
I
showed
a
significant
correlation
between
basal
spinal
BMD
and
the
percentage
change
of
BMD
during
the
observation
period
(
r
=
0.7
,
P
&
#
60
;
0.001
)

Changes
of
the
biochemical
parameters
were
observed
in
the
bone-specific
isoenzyme
of
alkaline
phosphatase
,
a
marker
of
osteoblastic
activity
,
in
group
I
giving
additional
evidence
of
increased
bone
formation

OBJECTIVES
:
To
estimate
the
prevalence
of
Chlamydia
trachomatis
in
asymptomatic
women
attending
general
practice
:
to
assess
the
potential
of
the
ligase
chain
reaction
as
a
screening
tool
;
and
to
evaluate
selective
screening
criteria

SETTING
:
Four
general
practices
in
northeast
London

SUBJECTS
:
890
women
aged
18-35
years
attending
general
practice
for
a
cervical
smear
or
a
``
young
well
woman
''
check
between
October
1994
and
January
1996

The
women
were
tested
for
C
trachomatis
with
confirmed
enzyme
immunoassay
(
endocervical
specimens
)
and
ligase
chain
reaction
assay
on
urine
specimens

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Prevalence
of
C
trachomatis
infection
in
women
aged
18-35
on
the
basis
of
each
test
;
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
both
tests
in
this
population

Prevalence
on
the
basis
of
ligase
chain
reaction
was
2.5
%
(
1.5
%
to
3.9
%
)
,
with
90
%
sensitivity
and
99.8
%
specificity

CONCLUSION
:
Ligase
chain
reaction
on
urine
samples
performs
at
least
as
well
as
enzyme
immunoassay
on
cervical
specimens
in
this
low
prevalence
population

A
simple
selective
screening
strategy
might
be
appropriate
and
would
be
able
to
detect
most
cases
of
infection

However
,
a
rigorous
economic
evaluation
of
possible
screening
strategies
is
needed
first

Recently
,
many
advances
have
been
made
in
the
study
of
sexual
differentiation
,
including
the
discoveries
of
the
gene
for
antimÃ1/4llerian
hormone
as
well
as
the
gene
for
its
receptor

However
,
the
etiology
of
the
clinical
syndrome
of
mÃ1/4llerian
agenesis
remains
elusive

We
hypothesize
that
activating
mutations
of
either
the
antimÃ1/4llerian
hormone
gene
or
its
receptor
gene
may
cause
mÃ1/4llerian
duct
regression
in
a
genetic
female
during
embryogenesis

However
,
animal
and
human
studies
have
demonstrated
toxic
effects
of
fenfluramines
that
clinicians
should
be
aware
of
when
considering
prescribing
the
drugs

STUDY
SELECTION
:
Reports
dealing
with
long-term
effects
of
fenfluramines
on
brain
serotonin

,
body
weight
,
and
pulmonary
function
in
animals
and
humans

DATA
EXTRACTION
:
Reports
were
reviewed
by
individuals
with
expertise
in
serotonin
neurobiology
,
neurotoxicity
,
neuropsychiatry
,
and
pulmonary
medicine
and
evaluated
for
appropriateness
for
inclusion
in
this
review

DATA
SYNTHESIS
:
Fenfluramines
cause
dose-related
,
long-lasting
reductions
in
serotonin
axonal
markers
in
all
the
animal
species
tested
and
with
all
the
routes
of
drug
administration
used

Doses
of
fenfluramines
that
produce
signs
of
brain
serotonin
neurotoxicity
in
animals
are
on
the
same
order
as
those
used
to
treat
humans
for
weight
loss
when
one
takes
into
account
known
relations
between
body
mass
and
drug
clearance

However
,
no
human
studies
have
been
conducted
,
and
the
pathological
and
clinical
potential
for
neurotoxicity
in
humans
is
unknown

CONCLUSIONS
:
Fenfluramine
and
dexfenfluramine
have
been
demonstrated
to
damage
brain
serotonin
neurons
in
animal
studies

Use
of
fenfluramines
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
PPH

Moxonidine
(
Physiotens-Solvay
)
was
introduced
last
year
as
the
first
of
a
new
class
of
centrally-acting
antihypertensive
agents
,
the
selective
imidazoline
receptor
agonists

Other
claims
suggest
that
it
causes
fewer
unwanted
effects
than
older
centrally-acting
antihypertensive
drugs
such
as
clonidine
and
methyldopa

Is
moxonidine
a
useful
addition
to
the
growing
number
of
antihypertensives
on
the
market
?

A
discussion
of
evaluative
techniques
for
assessing
anxiety
levels

Examination
and
treatment
planning
are
considered
in
relation
to
this
patient
's
special
needs

In
closing
,
the
author
presents
practical
information
regarding
prevention
of
dental
phobia
and
the
merits
of
incorporating
this
type
of
patient
into
a
dental
practice

In
order
to
evaluate
the
applicability
of
anthelminthic
treatment
of
wild
foxes
(
Vulpes
vulpes
)
to
limit
their
infection
with
Echinococcus
multilocularis
,
bait
pellets
,
each
containing
50
mg
praziquantel
,
were
repeatedly
distributed
in
an
area
of
566
km2
where
many
foxes
are
infected
,
in
southern
Germany

After
six
baiting
campaigns
(
15-20
baits/km2
)
over
a
period
of
14
months
,
the
prevalence
of
the
cestode
in
foxes
,
initially
32
%
,
had
fallen
to
4
%

While
the
potential

this

In
patients
with
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
(
CML
)
,
the
neoplastic
(
BCR-ABL+
)
progenitor
cells
are
characterized
by
an
increased
proliferative
activity

Whether
these
cells
are
also
resistant
to
apoptosis
and
if
so
,
under
what
conditions
remains
controversial

We
now
show
that
highly
purified
populations
of
very
primitive
neoplastic
progenitor
cells
obtained
directly
from
CML
patients
survive
and
proliferate
in
vitro
for
several
weeks
in
the
absence
of
any
added
growth
factors
(
except
insulin
)

Nevertheless
,
both
primary
CML
cells
and
BCR-ABL+
BAF3
cells
show
the
same
dose-dependent
sensitivity
to
TNF-alpha
or
ceramide-induced
apoptosis
as
their
respective
normal
counterparts

However
,
in
the
first
case
,
activation
of
apoptosis
is
blocked
by
the
basal
activity
of
p210
(
BCR-ABL
)
,
whereas
in
the
second
,
the
presence
of
p210
(
BCR-ABL
)
appears
to
accelerate
the
onset
of
apoptosis
by
a
mechanism
that
may
involve
an
activation
of
its
kinase
function

Clinically
,
the
hallmark
of
the
human
amnesic
syndrome
is
an
impaired
ability
to
consciously
recollect
or
remember
daily
events

If
the
medial
region
of
the
temporal
lobes
,
including
the
hippocampus
and
related
structures
,
is
critical
for
establishing
these
new
memories
,
then
this
brain
region
should
be
active
whenever
events
are
experienced
,
regardless
of
whether
subjects
are
asked
explicitly
to
learn
and
remember

These
findings
demonstrate
that
the
medial
temporal
lobe
memory
system
is
engaged
automatically
when
we
attend
to
a
perceptual
event
and
that
the
location
and
amount
of
activation
depend
on
stimulus
characteristics
(
physical
form
,
meaning
)
and
experience

The
involvement
of
structures
in
the
medial
temporal
lobe
during
the
encoding
of
visual
associations
was
studied
with
functional
magnetic
resonance
imaging

In
11
out
of
12
normal
healthy
volunteers
this
task
resulted
in
activation
in
posterior
portions
of
the
parahippocampal
region
,
close
to
the
collateral
sulcus

In
seven
subjects
activation
was
encountered
in
the
hippocampal
formation

The
visual
association
task
as
adapted
for
this
study
may
provide
a
sensitive
measure
to
study
anterograde
amnesia
prevalent
in
Alzheimer
's
disease

Therefore
,
the
present
paradigm
enables
the
study
of
individual
changes
in
learning
and
memory
capacities
over
time

Altered
calcium
(
Ca2+
)
homeostasis
is
thought
to
play
a
key
role
in
aging
and
neuropathology
resulting
in
memory
deficits

Several
forms
of
hippocampal
synaptic
plasticity
are
dependent
on
Ca2+
,
providing
a
potential
link
between
altered
Ca2+
homeostasis
and
memory
deficits
associated
with
aging

The
current
study
reviews
evidence
for
Ca2+
dysregulation
during
aging
which
could
interact
with
Ca
(
2+
)
-dependent
synaptic
plasticity

The
authors
suggest
that
changes
in
Ca2+
regulation
could
adjust
the
thresholds
for
synaptic
modification
,
favoring
processes
for
depression
of
synaptic
strength
during
aging

Other
studies
have
reported
TEOAEs
in
all
normal
ears

Differences
between
studies
may
arise
directly
from
criteria
for
TEOAE
identification
,
criteria
for
selection
of
normals
,
or
statistically
due
to
limited
sample
sizes

A
total
of
397
ears
from
highly
cooperative
adult
subjects
were
examined
under
laboratory
conditions

Using
cross
correlation
between
replicate
nonlinear
waveforms
as
the
criterion
,
TEOAEs
were
present
in
99.2
%
of
the
sample
(
lower
CI
98.1
%
)

While
TEOAE
strength
varies
widely
among
ears
,
no
clear
evidence
was
found
to
show
that
TEOAEs
can
be
absent
when
HTLs
are
normal

In
addition
to
a
long
form
of
591
amino
acids
(
aa
)
,
two
other
forms
of
PRL
receptor
(
PRLR
)
,
differing
in
the
length
of
their
cytoplasmic
domains
,
have
been
identified
in
the
rat

The
Nb2
form
,
lacking
198
aa
in
the
cytoplasmic
domain
,
is
able
to
transmit
a
lactogenic
signal
similar
to
the
long
form
,
whereas
the
short
form
of
291
aa
is
inactive

The
ability
of
PRL
to
activate
the
promoter
of
the
beta-casein
gene
or
the
lactogenic
hormone
responsive
element
fused
to
the
luciferase
reporter
was
assessed
in
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
or
293
fibroblasts
transiently
transfected
with
PRLR
cDNAs

We
cotransfected
Chinese
hamster
ovary
cells
with
two
cDNA
constructs
:
a
cytoplasmic
(
soluble
)
form
of
the
receptor
with
a
deleted
signal
peptide
(
delta-19
)
,
which
is
unable
to
bind
PRL
,
and
a
functionally
inactive
receptor
mutant
(
lacking
box
1
)
,
which
is
anchored
in
the
plasma
membrane
and
able
to
bind
PRL

This
approach
has
allowed
us
to
show
that
delta-19
,
lacking
expression
at
the
plasma
membrane
,
can
transduce
the
hormonal
message
,
at
least
to
a
limited
extent
(
up
to
30
%
of
wild
type
efficiency
)
,
providing
that
association/activation
occurs
with
a
PRL-PRLR
complex
initiated
at
the
cell
surface
level
;
box
1
of
the
cytoplasmic
form
is
necessary
to
rescue
this
partial
transcriptional
activity
of
the
inactive
mutant

Our
results
provide
evidence
that
heterodimerization
of
receptors
can
be
implicated
either
in
the
positive
or
in
negative
activation
of
gene
transcription

METHODS
:
We
studied
the
effects
of
three
years
of
dietary
supplementation
with
calcium
and
vitamin
D
on
bone
mineral
density
,
biochemical
measures
of
bone
metabolism
,
and
the
incidence
of
nonvertebral
fractures
in
176
men
and
213
women
65
years
of
age
or
older
who
were
living
at
home

They
received
either
500
mg
of
calcium
plus
700
IU
of
vitamin
D3
(
cholecalciferol
)
per
day
or
placebo

Bone
mineral
density
was
measured
by
dual-energy
x-ray
absorptiometry
,
blood
and
urine
were
analyzed
every
six
months
,
and
cases
of
nonvertebral
fracture
were
ascertained
by
means
of
interviews
and
verified
with
use
of
hospital
records

RESULTS
:
The
mean
(
+/-SD
)
changes
in
bone
mineral
density
in
the
calcium-vitamin
D
and
placebo
groups
were
as
follows
:
femoral
neck
,
+0.50+/-4.80
and
-0.70+/-5.03
percent
,
respectively
(
P=0.02
)
;
spine
,
+2.12+/-4.06
and
+1.22+/-4.25
percent
(
P=0.04
)
;
and
total
body
,
+0.06+/-1.83
and
-1.09+/-1.71
percent
(
P
&
#
60
;
0.001
)

The
difference
between
the
calcium-vitamin
D
and
placebo
groups
was
significant
at
all
skeletal
sites
after
one
year
,
but
it
was
significant
only
for
total-body
bone
mineral
density
in
the
second
and
third
years

Of
37
subjects
who
had
nonvertebral
fractures
,
26
were
in
the
placebo
group
and
11
were
in
the
calcium-vitamin
D
group
(
P=0.02
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
men
and
women
65
years
of
age
or
older
who
are
living
in
the
community
,
dietary
supplementation
with
calcium
and
vitamin
D
moderately
reduced
bone
loss
measured
in
the
femoral
neck
,
spine
,
and
total
body
over
the
three-year
study
period
and
reduced
the
incidence
of
nonvertebral
fractures

The
sterilization
and
contaminated
waste
disposal
practices
in
all
14
dental
clinics
operated
by
the
Southern
Sydney
Area
Health
Service
were
surveyed

All
of
the
clinics
used
autoclaves
for
sterilization

Chemical
disinfection
solutions
were
used
in
12
of
the
14
dental
clinics
,
mainly
for
surface
decontamination

Five
dental
clinics
had
separate
storage
areas
for
contaminated
waste
which
compiled
with
contaminated
waste
separation
and
disposal
guidelines

The
practice
of
recapping
needles
with
fingers
and
some
inadequate
washing
facilities
are
areas
that
require
particular
attention

Safety
and
efficacy
are
crucial
but
separate
issues
for
vitamin
and
mineral
supplements

Misinterpretation
of
``
safe
and
adequate
''
to
mean
``
safety
limit
''
would
impose
restrictions
on
vitamin
and
mineral
intakes
that
are
not
needed
to
ensure
safety

Substantial
evidence
indicates
that
intakes
greater
than
the
recommended
dietary
allowances
(
RDAs
)
of
certain
vitamins
and
minerals
such
as
calcium
,
folic
acid
,
vitamin
E
,
selenium
,
and
chromium
reduce
the
risk
of
certain
diseases
for
some
people

Limitation
of
intakes
to
the
RDAs
would
preclude
reductions
in
disease
risk
from
these
nutrients

The
margin
of
safety
between
the
usual
dietary
intake
and
the
intake
that
would
produce
adverse
effects
varies
greatly
among
the
different
nutrients

Very
high
intakes
of
vitamins
A
and
D
,
niacin
,
pyridoxine
,
and
selenium
have
produced
adverse
effects

Many
widely
discussed
putative
adverse
effects
of
vitamin
C
,
vitamin
E
,
and
trivalent
chromium
have
little
factual
basis

There
is
no
evidence
of
adverse
effects
from
beta-carotene
supplements
except
in
current
heavy
smokers

The
mutator
hypothesis
of
tumorigenesis
suggests
that
loss
of
chromosomal
stability
or
maintenance
functions
results
in
elevated
mutation
rates
,
leading
to
the
accumulation
of
the
numerous
mutations
required
for
multistep
carcinogenesis

Mutations
in
one
of
these
MMR
genes
,
hMSH2
,
account
for
about
half
of
all
cases
of
genetically
linked
hereditary
non-polyposis
colorectal
cancer

Loss
of
function
of
p53
has
also
been
proposed
to
increase
cellular
hypermutability
,
thereby
accelerating
carcinogenesis
,
although
a
clear
role
for
p53
in
genomic
instability
remains
controversial

p53
is
mutated
frequently
in
a
wide
range
of
human
cancers
,
including
colonic
tumours

Both
Msh2-
and
p53-targeted
knockout
mice
are
viable
and
susceptible
to
cancer

Here
we
demonstrate
that
combined
Msh2
and
p53
ablation
(
Msh2-/-p53-/-
)
results
in
developmental
arrest
of
all
female
embryos
at
9.5
days

In
contrast
,
male
Msh2-/-p53-/-
mice
are
viable
,
but
succumb
to
tumours
significantly
earlier
(
t1-2
is
73
days
)
than
either
Msh2-/-
or
p53-/-
littermates

Furthermore
,
the
frequency
of
microsatellite
instability
(
MSI
)
in
tumours
from
Msh2-/-p53-/-
mice
is
not
significantly
different
than
in
Msh2-/-
mice

Our
data
(

)
on
the
kinetics
of
the
repair
of
potentially

in
log-phase
Chinese
hamster
V79
cells
are
used
to
test
some
predictions
which
arise
from
the
different
assumptions
of
the

RMR
)
(

models

The
LPL
model
defines
the
time
available
for
repair
of
PLD
(
t
(
rep
)
)
as
the
time
taken
to
reach
maximal
survival
in
a
delayed-plating
recovery
experiment

Those
data
show
that
after
this
time
has
elapsed
,
contrary
to
the
expectation
of
the
LPL
model
,
survival
can
be
increased
by
changing
the
medium
used
for
delayed
plating
from
fresh
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium

According
to
the
RMR
model
,
all
potentially
lethal
lesions
should
also
be
committed
by
that
time
and
be
unavailable
for
repair
in
the
new
medium

Only
the
DSB
model
correctly
predicted
that
PLD
(
=
DSBs
)
would
still
be
available
for
repair
after
that
time

Second
,
data
for
split-dose
recovery
are
used
to
predict
the
first-order
kinetics
time
constant
for
DSB
repair
(
tau
(
DSBR
)
)
using
the
DSB
model
(
24
+/-
1.5
min
)

This
value
is
nearly
identical
to
the
value
of
27
+/-
1
min
determined
from
the
data
obtained
by
Cheong
et
al
.
using
pulsed-field
gel
electrophoresis
(
PFGE
)
(
Mutat

Res

274
,
111-122
,
1992
)

The
value
based
on
PFGE
is
used
to
calculate
the
value
of
t
(
rep
)
predicted
by
the
DSB
model
(
2.6
+/-
0.1
h
)
,
which
agrees
with
the
value
determined
experimentally
as
the
time
when
changing
the
delayed-plating
medium
from
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium
no
longer
gives
the
full
recovery
seen
with
delayed
plating
in
conditioned
medium
(
2.5
h
)

The
early
t
(
rep
)
,
associated
with
tau
(
fast
)
,
is
predicted
to
be
1.7
+/-
0.7
h
,
and
the
late
t
(
rep
)
,
associated
with
tau
(
slow
)
,
is
predicted
to
be
about
5
h.
Both
values
are
in
excellent
agreement
with
the
times
at
which
changing
from
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium
no
longer
gives
the
full
recovery
seen
in
conditioned
medium
only
(
the
early
t
(
rep
)
)
,
and
the
time
when
changing
from
growth
medium
to
conditioned
medium
produces
no
further
increase
in
survival
(
the
late
t
(
rep
)
)
,
respectively

It
is
noted
that
attempts
to
correlate
radiosensitivity
with
the
rates
of
DSB
repair
,
rather
than
using
an
explicit
model
such
as
the
DSB
model
,
are
unlikely
to
be
productive
since
survival
depends
on
both
tau
(
DSBR
)
and
t
(
rep
)
(
as
defined
in
the
DSB
model
)
and
the
latter
may
be
the
more
important
determinant
of
radiosensitivity
(
as
it
appears
to
be
for
ataxia
telangiectasia
cells
compared
to
normal
fibroblasts
and
for
irs
compared
to
V79
cells
)

CONTEXT
:
Adolescents
'
concerns
about
privacy
in
clinical
settings
decrease
their
willingness
to
seek
health
care
for
sensitive
problems
and
may
inhibit
their

with
physicians

OBJECTIVE
:
To
investigate
the
influence
of
physicians
'
assurances
of

on
adolescents
'
willingness
to
disclose
information
and
seek

SETTING
:
Three

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Adolescents
'
willingness
to

topics
,
intended
honesty
,
and
likelihood

scenario
were
assessed
by
anonymous

RESULTS
:
Assurances
of
confidentiality
increased
the
number
of
adolescents
willing
to
disclose
sensitive
information
about
sexuality
,

use
,
and

from
39
%

When
comparing

increased
the

CONCLUSIONS
:
Adolescents
are
more
willing

Further

BACKGROUND
:
Diabetic
foot
infections
cause
substantial
morbidity
and
mortality

Neutrophil
superoxide
generation
,
a
crucial
part
of
neutrophil
bactericidal
activity
,
is
impaired
in
diabetes

We
assessed
G-CSF
as
adjuvant
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
severe
foot
infections
in
diabetic
patients

Both
groups
received
similar
antibiotic
and
insulin
treatment

No
G-CSF-treated
patient
needed
surgery
,
whereas
two
placebo
recipients
underwent
to
amputation
and
two
had
extensive
debridement
under
anaesthesia

G-CSF
therapy
was
generally
well
tolerated

This
improvement
may
be
related
to
an
increase
in
neutrophil
superoxide
production

BACKGROUND
:
Accelerated
infusion
of
alteplase
(
tissue
plasminogen
activator
)
over
a
period
of
90
minutes
induces
more
rapid
lysis
of
coronary-artery
thrombi
than
a
3-hour
infusion

With
two
bolus
doses
of
alteplase
,
further
shortening
the
duration
of
administration
,
complete
reperfusion
was
achieved
in
more
than
85
percent
of
the
patients
in
initial
angiographic
studies

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
double-bolus
alteplase
is
at
least
as
effective
as
accelerated
infusion

METHODS
:
In
398
hospitals
,
7169
patients
with
acute
myocardial
infarction
were
randomly
assigned
to
weight-adjusted
,
accelerated
infusion
of
100
mg
of
alteplase
or
to
a
bolus
of
50
mg
of
alteplase
over
a
period
of
1
to
3
minutes
followed
30
minutes
later
by
a
second
bolus
of
50
mg
(
or
40
mg
for
patients
who
weighed
less
than
60
kg
)

The
primary
end
point
was
death
from
any
cause
at
30
days

The
trial
was
stopped
prematurely
because
of
concern
about
the
safety
of
the
double-bolus
injection

RESULTS
:
Thirty-day
mortality
was
higher
in
the
double-bolus
group
than
in
the
accelerated-infusion
group
:
7.98
percent
as
compared
with
7.53
percent

Therefore
,
accelerated
infusion
of
alteplase
over
a
period
of
90
minutes
remains
the
preferred
regimen

BACKGROUND
:
Fenfluramine
and
phentermine
have
been
individually
approved
as
anorectic
agents
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)

When
used
in
combination
the
drugs
may
be
just
as
effective
as
either
drug
alone
,
with
the
added
advantages
of
the
need
for
lower
doses
of
each
agent
and
perhaps
fewer
side
effects

Although
the
combination
has
not
been
approved
by
the
FDA
,
in
1996
the
total
number
of
prescriptions
in
the
United
States
for
fenfluramine
and
phentermine
exceeded
18
million

The
women
presented
with
cardiovascular
symptoms
or
a
heart
murmur

As
increasing
numbers
of
these
patients
with
similar
clinical
features
were
identified
,
there
appeared
to
be
an
association
between
these
features
and
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy

RESULTS
:
Twenty-four
women
(
mean
(
+/-SD
)
age
,
44+/-8
years
)
were
evaluated
12.3+/-7.1
months
after
the
initiation
of
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy

Echocardiography
demonstrated
unusual
valvular
morphology
and
regurgitation
in
all
patients

To
date
,
cardiac
surgical
intervention
has
been
required
in
five
patients

The
histopathological
features
were
identical
to
those
seen
in
carcinoid
or
ergotamine-induced
valve
disease

CONCLUSIONS
:
These
cases
arouse
concern
that
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy
may
be
associated
with
valvular
heart
disease

Candidates
for
fenfluramine-phentermine
therapy
should
be
informed
about
serious
potential
adverse
effects
,
including
pulmonary
hypertension
and
valvular
heart
disease

all
patients
presenting

with
a
symptomatic

arthroplasty
refractory
to

and
the

,
these
patients
stated
that
their
level
of
pain
,
walking
tolerance
,
and
overall
satisfaction
improved
significantly
after
the
arthrodesis

Clinically
,
there
was
no
evidence
of
transfer
lesions
,
tenderness
,
or
hallux
subluxation

Despite
this
,
patient
satisfaction
was
high

Arthrodesis
of
the
first
metatarsophalangeal
joint
using
a
bone
graft
to
salvage
failed
silicone
implant
arthroplasty
produces
acceptable
subjective
and
radiographic
results

Although
technically
demanding
,
it
provides
long-term
stability
to
the
hallux
,
restores
weightbearing
,
and
allows
for
maintenance
of
a
propulsive
gait

We
recommend
this
procedure
instead
of
an
excisional
arthroplasty
to
maintain
high
level
of
function
and
overall
patient
satisfaction

DESIGN
:
Prospective
community-based
study

SETTING
:
Black
residents
of
Harare
,
Zimbabwe

RESULTS
:
The
crude
incidence
rate
was
estimated
to
be
30.7
per
100000
(
95
%
confidence
interval
27.1-34.4
)
and
the
standardised
rate
was
68
per
100000

CONCLUSION
:
With
a
standardised
rate
of
68
per
100000
and
a
first-week
mortality
rate
of
35
%
,
stroke
must
now
be
considered
an
important
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
in
the
population

OBJECTIVE
:
To
explore
the
long-term
effect
of
calcium
supplementation
during
pregnancy
on
the
offspring
's
blood
pressure
during
childhood

DESIGN
:
Follow
up
of
a
population
enrolled
in
a
double
blind
,
randomised
,
placebo
controlled
trial

SETTING
:
Perinatal
research
unit
,
World
Health
Organisation
's
collaborative
research
centre

SUBJECTS
:
591
children
at
a
mean
age
of
7
years
whose
mothers
were
randomly
assigned
during
pregnancy
to
receive
2
g/day
of
elemental
calcium
(
n
=
298
)
or
placebo
(
n
=
293
)

RESULTS
:
Overall
,
systolic
blood
pressure
was
lower
in
the
calcium
group
(
mean
difference
-1.4
mm
Hg
;
95
%
confidence
interval
-3.2
to
0.5
)
than
in
the
placebo
group

The
effect
was
found
predominantly
among
children
whose
body
mass
index
at
assessment
was
above
the
median
for
this
population
(
mean
difference
in
systolic
blood
pressure
-5.8
mm
Hg
(
-9.8
mm
Hg
to
-1.7
mm
Hg
)
for
children
with
an
index
>
17.5
and
-3.2
mm
Hg
(
-6.3
mm
Hg
to
-0.1
mm
Hg
)
for
those
with
an
index
of
>
15.7
to
17.5
)

The
risk
of
high
systolic
blood
pressure
was
also
lower
in
the
calcium
group
than
in
the
placebo
group
(
relative
risk
0.59
;
0.39
to
0.90
)
and
particularly
among
children
in
the
highest
fourth
of
body
mass
index
(
0.43
;
0.26
to
0.71
)

The
fast
reaction
of
peroxynitrite
with
CO2
and
the
high
concentration
of
dissolved
CO2
in
vivo
(
ca

1
mM
)
suggest
that
CO2
modulates
most
of
the
reactions
of
peroxynitrite
in
biological
systems

We
now
show
that
the
formation
of
1
is
followed
by
reformation
of
CO2
(
rather
than
another
carbonate
species
such
as
CO3
=
or
HCO3-
)

To
show
this
,
it
is
necessary
to
study
systems
with
limiting
concentrations
of
CO2

(
When
CO2
is
present
in
excess
,
its
concentration
remains
nearly
constant
during
the
decomposition
of
peroxynitrite
,
and
the
recycling
of
CO2
,
although
it
occurs
,
can
not
be
detected
kinetically
)

We
find
that
CO2
is
a
true
catalyst
of
the
decomposition
of
peroxynitrite
,
and
this
fundamental
insight
into
its
action
must
be
rationalized
by
any
in
vivo
or
in
vitro
reaction
mechanism
that
is
proposed

When
the
concentration
of
CO2
is
lower
than
that
of
peroxynitrite
,
the
reformation
of
CO2
amplifies
the
fraction
of
peroxynitrite
that
reacts
with
CO2

Even
low
concentrations
of
CO2
that
result
from
the
dissolution
of
ambient
CO2
can
have
pronounced
catalytic
effects

These
effects
can
cause
deviations
from
predicted
kinetic
behavior
in
studies
of
peroxynitrite
in
noncarbonate
buffers
in
vitro
,
and
since
1
and
other
intermediates
derived
from
it
are
oxidants
and/or
nitrating
agents
,
some
of
the
reactions
attributed
to
peroxynitrite
may
depend
on
the
availability
of
CO2

A
prospective
,
randomized
,
placebo-controlled
,
double-blind
,
parallel-group
,
6-month
study
assessed
the
efficacy
and

of
ropinirole

a
nonergoline
D2-dopamine

in
patients
with

Patients
(
mean
age
,
62.8
years
)
,
stratified
by
concomitant
use
of
selegiline
,
were
randomized
to
ropinirole
(
n
=

)
or
placebo
(
n

The
starting
dose
of
ropinirole
was
0.25
mg

with

to
at
least
1.5
mg

(
maximum
dose

Ropinirole
was
well
tolerated
and
patient
withdrawals
were
infrequent

Starfish
oocytes
can
be
fertilized
after
germinal
vesicle
breakdown
(
GVBD
)
and
artificial
parthenogenesis
can
be
induced
by
activating
the
oocytes
after
GVBD
(
post-GVBD
activation
)

Most
of
the
caffeine-treated
eggs
developed
as
tetraploids
,
as
parthenogenotes
produced
by
the
post-GVBD
activation

The
parthengenotes
were
derived
only
from
eggs
that
failed
to
extrude
polar
bodies
,
mostly
from
eggs
failing
to
extrude
a

,
treated
with

We
hypothesized
that
fluoride
partly
acts
by
changing
the
levels
of
circulating
calcium-regulating
hormones
and
skeletal
growth
factors

The
effects
of
oral
fluoride
on
24
female
,
Dutch-Belted
,
young
adult
rabbits
were
studied

The
rabbits
were
divided
into
two
study
groups
,
one
control
and
the
other
receiving
about
16
mg
fluoride/rabbit/day
in
their
drinking
water

After
6
months
of
fluoride
dosing
,
all
rabbits
were
euthanized
and
bone
and
blood
samples
were
taken
for
analyses

Fluoride
treatment
increased
serum
and
bone
fluoride
levels
by
over
an
order
of
magnitude
(
P

#

;

)
,
but
did
not
affect
body

or
the
following
serum

variables
:
urea
,
creatinine
,
phosphorus
,
total

,
albumin
,
bilirubin
,
SGOT
,
or
total

<

No
skeletal
fluorosis
or
osteomalacia
was
observed
histologically
,
nor
did
fluoride
affect
serum
PTH
or
Vitamin

metabolites
(
P

)

BAP
was
increased
37
%
(

by

;
serum

increased

;
serum
IGF-1
was
increased

(

However
,
the
increases
in
bone
mass
and
bone
formation
were
not
reflected
in
improved
bone

Fluoride
decreased
bone
strength
by
about

in
the

In
conclusion
,
fluoride
's
effects
on
bone
mass
and
bone
turnover
were
not
mediated
by
PTH

IGF-1
was
increased
by

PURPOSE
:
To
determine
the
effect
of
various
methods
of
managing
the
posterior
capsule
and
anterior
vitreous
on
the
rate
of
posterior
capsule
opacification
in
pediatric
eyes
implanted
with
posterior
chamber
intraocular
lenses
(
PC
IOLs
)

METHODS
:
We
reviewed
the
charts
of
20
eyes
of
15
children
(
aged
1.5
to
2
years
)
who
had
primary
cataract
surgery
with
PC
IOL
implantation
during
the
past
5
years

The
posterior
capsule
and
anterior
vitreous
were
managed
in
a
variety
of
ways
:
In
5
eyes
,
the
posterior
capsule
was
left
intact
;
in
15
eyes
,
a
posterior
continuous
curvilinear
capsulorhexis
(
PCCC
)
was
performed
-
6
with
and
9
without
anterior
vitrectomy
;
in
8
eyes
,
posterior
optic
capture
was
performed
-
3
with
and
5
without
vitrectomy

The
follow-up
ranged
from
1
to
4.5
years
(
mean
2
years
)

RESULTS
:
Visually
significant
secondary
cataract
developed
in
the
five
eyes
with
intact
posterior
capsules
and
in
the
four
eyes
that
had
PCCC
without
vitrectomy
and
without
posterior
optic
capture
(
i.e
.
,
the
optic
was
left
in
the
capsular
bag
)

The
optical
axis
remained
clear
in
the
six
eyes
that
had
PC
IOL
implantation
with
vitrectomy
(
with
or
without
posterior
optic
capture
)

Initially
,
all
eyes
that
had
optic
capture
without
vitrectomy
also
remained
clear
,
but
after
6
months
,
four
of
five
developed
opacification

CONCLUSION
:
In
this
series
,
PCCC
with
anterior
vitrectomy
was
the
only
effective
method
of
preventing
or
delaying
secondary
cataract
formation
in
infants
and
children

In
the
present
study
the
potent
5-HT1A
receptor
agonist
,
8-hydroxy-2-
(
di-n-propylamino
)
-tetralin
(
8-OH-DPAT
)
was
tested
for
its
effect
on
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
in
rainbow
trout
(
Oncorhynchus
mykiss
)

Blood
was
sampled
and
8-OH-DPAT
administered
through
a
catheter
in
the
dorsal
aorta

Thirty
minutes
after
the
injection
of
40
microg
of
8-OH-DPAT/kg
,
plasma
cortisol
levels
had
increased
from
12
to
149
ng/ml
,
whereupon
they
fell
,
reaching
baseline
levels
after
4
h.
The
effect
of
1-40
microg
8-OH-DPAT/kg
on
plasma
cortisol
concentrations
was
dose-dependent

The
results
lends
further
support
to
the
hypothesis
that
the
brain
serotonergic
system
plays
a
key
role
in
integrating
autonomic
,
behavioral
and
neuroendocrine
stress-responses
in
fish
as
well
as
mammals
,
suggesting
that
not
only
the
structural
and
biochemical
organization
,
but
also
the
function
of
the
serotonergic
system
has
been
conserved
during
vertebrate
evolution

OBJECTIVE
:
To
assess
the
medicalising
effect
of
prescribing
antibiotics
for
sore
throat

SETTING
:
11
general
practices
in
England

DESIGN
:
Randomised
trial
of
three
approaches
to
sore
throat
:
a
10
day
prescription
of
antibiotics
,
no
antibiotics
,
or
a
delayed
prescription
if
the
sore
throat
had
not
started
to
settle
after
three
days

PATIENTS
:
716
patients
aged
4
and
over
with
sore
throat
and
an
abnormal
physical
sign
:
84
%
had
tonsillitis
or
pharyngitis

OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Number
and
rate
of
patients
making
a
first
return
with
sore
throat
,
pharyngitis
,
or
tonsillitis

Early
returns
(
within
two
weeks
)
and
complications
(
otitis
media
,
sinusitis
,
quinsy
)

Outcomes
were
documented
in
675
subjects
(
94
%
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
Complications
and
early
return
resulting
from
no
or
delayed
prescribing
of
antibiotics
for
sore
throat
are
rare

To
avoid
medicalising
a
self
limiting
illness
doctors
should
avoid
antibiotics
or
offer
a
delayed
prescription
for
most
patients
with
sore
throat

Granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(
G-CSF
)
has
been
used
to
improve
granulocyte

in
chronic
neutropenia
and
myelodysplasia
,
to
minimize
the
incidence

duration
of

,
and
to
mobilize

prior
to

The

also
occurred

However

no

Evidence-based
medicine
(
EBM
)
aids
clinical
decision
making
in
all
fields
of
medicine
,
including
primary
care

General
practice
is
characterized
by
particular
emphasis
on
the
doctor-patient
relationship
and
on
biomedical
,
personal
and
contextual
perspectives
in
diagnosis

Most
evidence
available
to
general
practitioners
(
GPs
)
addresses
only
the
bio-medical
perspective
and
is
often
not
directly
applicable
to
primary
care
,
as
it
derives
from
secondary
or
tertiary
care

Emphasis
on
the
biomedical
domain
and
the
randomized
controlled
trial
(
RCT
)
alone
reflects
a
reductionist
approach
that
fails
to
do
justice
to
the
philosophy
of
general
practice

The
art
of
medicine
is
founded
on
context
,
anecdote
,
patient
stories
of
illness
and
personal
experience
,
and
we
should
continue
to
blend
this
with
good
quality
and
appropriate
research
findings
in
patient
care

Abdominal
tuberculosis
is
not
uncommon
in
the
UK
,
especially
in
Asian
immigrants

It
resembles
Crohn
's
disease
clinically
and
radiologically
,
and
it
may
be
difficult
to
differentiate
between
them
,
even
at
laparotomy
or
histology

The
distinction
is
important
,
however
,
for
proper
management
of
the
two
conditions

The
data
were
then
meta-analyzed
to
produce
outcome
estimates
for
alternative
surgical
procedures

RESULTS
:
The
data
indicate
that
after
48
months
retropubic
suspensions
and
slings
appear
to
be
more
efficacious
than
transvaginal
suspensions
,
and
also
more
efficacious
than
anterior
repairs

The
literature
suggests
higher
complication
rates
when
synthetic
materials
are
used
for
slings

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
panel
found
sufficient
acceptable
long-term
outcomes
data
(
longer
than
48
months
)
to
conclude
that
surgical
treatment
of
female
stress
urinary
incontinence
is
effective
,
offering
a
long-term
cure
in
a
significant
percentage
of
women

Retropubic
suspensions
and
slings
are
the
most
efficacious
procedures
for
long-term
success
(
based
on
cure/dry
rates
)

However

A
55-year-old
lady
underwent
repeat
aortic
valve
replacement
using
a
16-mm
Carbomedics
prosthesis

She
made
an
uneventful
postoperative
recovery
and
now
leads
an
unrestricted
life

Doppler
echocardiography
reveals
a
21-mm

We
therefore
evaluated
the
effect
of
cure
of
Helicobacter
pylori
infection
on
basal
and
pentagastrin-stimulated
acid
secretion

RESULTS
:
The
gastritis
index
was
significantly
lower
after
therapy
and
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
both
BAO
and
MAO
after
cure
of
the
H.

infection
(
BAO
from
0.3
mmol/h
and
MAO
from
4.8
mmol/h
to
19
mmol/

)

Basal
and
stimulated
acid

also
increased
(
29.1
+/-
36.6
to
54
+/-
31
mmol/l
and
72.5
+/-

to
120.1

CONCLUSION
:
Gastric
acid
secretion
increased
into
the
normal
range
after
successful
treatment
of
H.
pylori
infection
,
suggesting
that
gastric
function
can
recover
to
normal
or
almost
normal
after
cure
of
H.

infection

OBJECTIVE
:
Reports
suggest
that
there
is
an
increased
incidence
of
preeclampsia
after
a
previously
normal
pregnancy
if
there
is
a
change
in
paternity

STUDY
DESIGN
:
This
was
a
retrospective
cohort
study

In
women
with
primary
infertility
all
pregnancies
achieved
by
either
partner
or
donor
intrauterine
insemination
carried
to
birth
of
a
fetus
(
>
20
weeks
)
were
identified

The
medical
records
were
examined
for
the
maternal
and
pregnancy
outcome
data

The
relative
risk
and
95
%
confidence
interval
were
calculated
for
the
risk
of
preeclampsia

The
baseline
data
were
compared
with
t
tests
,
chi
2
analysis
and
Fisher
's
exact
test
where
appropriate

RESULTS
:
Forty-four
patients
in
the
partner
intrauterine
insemination
group
and
37
in
the
donor
insemination
group
were
identified
as
having
primary
infertility

CONCLUSIONS
:
There
is
a
higher
incidence
of
preeclampsia
in
women
conceiving
by
intrauterine
insemination
with
washed
donor
sperm
compared
with
intrauterine

with
washed

sperm
.

CONCLUSIONS
:
There
is
a
higher
incidence
of
preeclampsia
in
women
conceiving
by
intrauterine
insemination
with
washed
donor
sperm
compared
with
intrauterine

This
supports
,
indirectly
,
an
immunologic
basis
for
preeclampsia

After
a
rapid
examination
of
a
few
basic
concepts
concerning
cellular
aging
and
programmed
cell
death
,
the
aging
of
the
tissues
and
organs
,
the
authors
discuss
the
principal
theories
on
senescence

They
underline
that
it
is
necessary
to
agree
in
considering
the
various
genetic
and
epigenetic
,
endogenous
and
exogenous
mechanisms
that
lead
to
the
complex
aging
phenomenon
multiple
and
interrelated

In
particular
they
stress
the
hypothesis
that
senescence
can
be
due
to
a
sum
of
molecular
damages
caused
by
free
radicals
,
and
to
the
loss
of
telomeric
DNA

The
telomerase
prevents
the
shortening
of
telomeres
in
neoplastic
cells
and
therefore
renders
them
immortal

Paradoxically
the
protection
of
the
telomere
is
exactly
what
must
be
avoided
in
the
case
of
tumor
cells

Recently
the
demonstration
that
telomerase
is
not
always
involved
in
the
restoration
of
telomere
length
shows
the
complexity
of
the
problems
connected
to
the
cause
of
senescence

Chromosomally
integrated
retroviral
switch
(
S
)
substrates
have
been
developed
to
reveal
switch
recombinase-like
activities
(
SRLA
)
in
pre-B
and
mature
B
cell
lines

By
initially
selecting
for
proviral
integrants
in
hygromycin
followed
by
shifting
into
neomycin
+
ganciclovir
to
select
for
S
sequence-mediated
deletions
,
switch
recombinations
can
be
specifically
forestalled
in
B
cell
lines
whilst
most
switch-incompetent
cells
do
not
survive
secondary
selection

A
qualitative
,
direct
PCR
assay
reveals
that
SSR
recombinations
are
stochastic
in
B
cell
lines
generating
a
product
array
akin
to
natural
GH
class
switching

A
semi-quantitative
DC-PCR
assay
detects
a
significant
recombinase
activity
only
in
a
restricted
set
of
late
stage
pre-B
and
mature
B
cell
lines

BCL1B1
mature
B
cells
have
the
highest
level
of
recombinase
activity
with
25
%
or
more
of
proviral
integrants
accumulating
S
mu/S
gamma
2b
substrate
recombinations
within
10-14
cell
generations

The
SSR
recombinase
assay
can
be
performed
in
a
transient
fashion
wherein
extensive
,
B
cell-specific
recombination
can
be
visualized
within
only
a
few
cell
divisions
post
proviral
integration

We
propose
that
switch
recombinase
activity
becomes
activated
during
B
cell
ontogeny
independent
of
or
prior
to
the
acquisition
of
CH
locus
accessibility
and
that
endogenous
S
segment
targeting
to
pre-existing
recombinase
requires
a
level
of
accessibility
beyond
transcriptional
activation

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
the
prevalence
of
illicit
drug
abuse
and
alcohol
use
in
an
obstetric
population
based
in
an
urban
maternity
hospital

DESIGN
:
A
prospective
study
consisting
of
anonymous
,
unlinked
urine
testing
of
504
'first
visit
'
antenatal
patients
and
a
separate
group
of
515
patients
six
weeks
after
delivery

METHODS

;
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
Toxicological
screening
using
enzyme-linked
immunoassay
techniques
,
with
all
positive
samples
being
reanalysed

Drug
histories
were
taken
and
samples
were
tested
for
alcohol
and
six
of
the
most
commonly
abused
drugs

Substances
identified
included
benzodiazepines
,
cannabis
,
amphetamines
,
opiates
and
cocaine

Less
than
2
%
of
samples
tested
positive
for
alcohol

None
of
the
women
yielding
positive
samples
had
been
pre-identified
on
the
basis
of
history

A
significant
proportion
of
the
women
were
in
the
high
risk
categories
with
regard
to
age
and
socio-economic
status

CONCLUSION
:
The
prevalence
of
drug
misuse
antenatally
was
nearly
3
%
and
postnatally
almost
6
%

Substance
abusers
in
pregnancy
are
more
likely
to
be
single
,
unemployed
,
and
to
have
had
a
previous

Schizophrenic
illnesses
occur
with
approximately
the
same
incidence
in
all
human
populations
with
a
characteristic
distribution
(
slightly
earlier
in
males
)
of
ages
of
onset

Given
that
the
predisposition
(
which
presumably
is
genetic
)
is
associated
with
a
procreative
disadvantage
why
do
such
illnesses
persist
?
Here
it
is
suggested
that
these
conditions
are
a
manifestation
of
genetic
diversity
in
the
evolution
of
the
specifically
human
characteristic
of
language
,
an
innovation
that
has
occurred
by
a
process
of
progressive
hemispheric
specialization-the
establishment
of
dominance
for
some
critical
component
of
language
in
one
or
the
other
hemisphere

Individuals
who
develop
schizophrenic
symptoms
show
lesser
anatomical
and
functional
asymmetries
than
the
population
as
a
whole
;
such
symptoms
may
reflect
'dominance
failure
'
for
language

Prenatal
diagnosis
can
be
difficult
especially
if
they
present
in
late

Here
we
present
two

and
review
the
literature
regarding
prenatal
diagnosis
of
cloacal
anomalies

DESIGN
:
Blinded

of
randomly

of
cardiac
amyloidosis

SETTING
:
International

RESULTS
:
Familial
and
AL
echocardiograms
were
morphologically
indistinguishable
,
with
similar

similar
between
amyloid
types

,
respectively

Doppler
indices
of
left
and
right

,
and
ejection

were
also
similar

Low

electrocardiograms
(

mV
)
were
more
common
in
the
AL
(
16/24

)
than
in
the
familial
group
(
4/12

)
,
P

The

)
nu
38
%
(

)
,
respectively
,
with
virtually
all
deaths
due
to
cardiac
causes

CONCLUSIONS
:
Although
cardiac
involvement
is
echocardiographically
indistinguishable
,
cardiac
mortality
is
very
different
between
the
two
forms
of
amyloidosis

Preservation
of
electrocardiographic
voltage
in
familial
amyloidosis
suggests
that
the
particular
biochemical
characteristics
of
distinct
types
of
amyloid
fibril
have
different
pathological
effects
on
the
myocardium

This
distinction
becomes
critical
in
the
evaluation
,
treatment
,
and
management
of
patients
who
have
a
diagnosis
within
the
spectrum
of
the
protein

and
diabetic
retinopathy
in
Pima
Indians
with

diabetes

RESEARCH
DESIGN
AND
METHODS
:
We
studied
171
Pima
Indians
with
type
2
diabetes
between
the
ages
of
30-70
years
in
a
population-based
epidemiological
survey

Plasma
PAI-1
activity
was
measured
by
a
spectrophotometric
assay
and
PAI-1
4G/5G
promoter
genotype
by
the
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
using
allele-specific
primers

RESULTS
:
Retinopathy
was
present
in
70
(
41
%
)
subjects
,
and
4
(
2.3
%
)
subjects
had
proliferative
retinopathy

Plasma
PAI-1
activity
was
not
significantly
different
among
subjects
with
and
without
retinopathy
(
17.1
+/-
vs.
19.7
+/-
9.1
arbitrary
units
(
AU
)
/ml
,
P
=

)

PAI-1
activity
was
negatively
correlated
with
duration
of
diabetes
(
rs
=
-0.18
,
P
=
0.02
)

In
a
logistic
regression
analysis
controlled
for
age
,
sex
,
BMI
,
and
duration
of
diabetes
,
any
retinopathy
was
significantly
associated
with
fasting
plasma
glucose
concentrations
(
P
&
#

;
0.05
)
,
2-h
postload

(

,
and
HbA1c
(
P
=
0.008
)
,
but
not
with
PAI-1
activity
(
P
=
0.48
)

The
prevalence
of
retinopathy
in
the
three
genotype
groups
differed
significantly
(
4G/4G
,
4G/5G
,
and
5G/5G
were
44

,
respectively
;
chi

and
remained
significant
after
controlling
for
age
,
sex
,
BMI
,
duration
of
diabetes
,
glycated
hemoglobin
,
and
urine
albumin-to-creatine
ratio
in
a
logistic
regression
analysis

The
odds
ratios
for
retinopathy
in
subjects
with
4G/4G
and
4G/5G
,
compared
with
the
5G/5G
genotype
,
were
2.0
and
3.1
,
respectively

CONCLUSIONS
:
Although
diabetic
retinopathy
in
Pima
Indians
with
type
2
diabetes
is
not
associated
with
PAI-1
activity
,
subjects
with
the
4G/4G
and
4G/5G
genotype
had
a
higher
prevalence
of
retinopathy
compared
with
5G/5G
PAI-1genotype

These
preliminary
findings
indicate
that
in
Pima
Indians
with
type
2
diabetes
,
presence
of
the
4G
allele
of
the
PAI-1
gene
was
associated
with
a
higher
risk
of
diabetic
retinopathy

BACKGROUND
:
Diagnostic
peritoneal
lavage
(
DPL
)
is
used
to
diagnose
intra-abdominal
injury
in
patients
with
stab
wounds
and
blunt
trauma

Because
exploratory
celiotomy
is
routinely
performed
on
patients
with
gunshot
wounds
to
the
abdomen
,
DPL
is
rarely
employed

However
,
several
studies
have
questioned
routine
exploration
and
have
drawn
attention
to
the
associated
morbidity
of
negative
celiotomy

OBJECTIVE
:
To
evaluate
the
performance
of
DPL
in
the
diagnosis
of
intra-abdominal
injury
in
hemodynamically
stable
patients
with
gunshot

DESIGN
:
A

SETTING
:
Two

PATIENTS
:
Patients
with
gunshot
wounds
to
the
abdomen
and
a
systolic
blood
pressure
of
at

90
mm

INTERVENTIONS
:
Clinical
predication
of
intra-abdominal
injury
in
the
emergency
department
and
DPL
performed
in
the
operating
room
before
the
initiation
of
celiotomy

Injuries
found
during
the
celiotomy
were
recorded

MAIN
OUTCOME
MEASURES
:
The
results
of
the
clinical
evaluation
and
DPL
were
compared
with
the
findings
of
the
celiotomy

RESULTS
:
Forty-four
patients
were
enrolled
into
the
study

Diagnostic
peritoneal
lavage
correctly
identified
the
presence
or
absence
of
intra-abdominal
injury
in
40
(
91
%
)
of
the
patients
(

that
may
augment
clinical

BACKGROUND
:
To

Blastocystis
hominis
parasitation
and
to
ascertain
its
role
as
an

a
prospective
study
during

months
pathogen
has
been
carried
out

SUBJECTS
AND
METHODS
:
The
study
included
2
,
039
patients
,
which
were
classified
in
three
groups
(
asymptomatic
(
group
A
)
,
with
suspicion
of
parasitosis
(
group
B
)
,
with
diarrhoea
(
group
C
)
)

In
all
cases
a
coproparasitological
study
was
performed

In
the
group
C
the
presence
of
non-parasitic
enteropathogens
was
also
investigated

In
patients
with
B

hominis
in
the
absence
of
other
pathogens
clinical
and
epidemiological
characteristics
were
evaluated

B

hominis
was
identified
in
336
patients
(
16.5
%
)

The
frequency
of
parasitation
was
superior
in
adults
(
p
&
#
60
;
0.0001
)
,
with
a
slight
predominance
in
the
female
sex

The
rate
of
asymptomatic
carriers
was
3.3
%

Statistical
significant
association
was
found
between
B

hominis
,
in
absence
of
other
pathogens
and
the
presence
of
clinical
manifestations
(
p
&
#
60
;
0.0001
)
,
the
most
common
of
which
were
diarrhoea
and
abdominal
pain

We
did
not
find
a
statistically
significant
association
between
the
number
of
B

The
vacuolar
form
was
the
predominant
morphological
type

The
ameboid
form
was
observed
only
in
diarrhoeal
stools

CONCLUSIONS
:
B

hominis
is
the
most
frequent
parasite
found
in
faecal
parasitological
investigation

In
absence
of
other
causes
,
B

hominis
must
be
considered
as
a

OBJECTIVE
:
To
test
the
hypothesis
that
liver
glutamine
synthetase
deficiency
may
explain
hyperammonemia
in
patients
who
have
had
organ
transplantation
or
are
receiving
chemotherapy

DESIGN
:
Case
report

PATIENTS
:
Two
patients
who
had
fatal
hyperammonemia
after
orthotopic
lung
transplantation
.

MEASUREMENTS
:
Liver
tissue
was
analyzed
to
determine
the
activities
of
two
urea
cycle
enzymes
and
glutamine
synthetase

Western
blot
assays
for
hepatic
glutamine
synthetase
were
performed
to
determine
whether
glutamine
synthetase
deficiency
resulted
from
reduced
enzyme
levels

RESULTS
:
Activities
of
carbamoyl
phosphate
synthetase
I
and
ornithine
carbamoyltransferase
in
the
liver
were
normal

<
TO_SEE
>
CONCLUSION
:
Hyperammonemia
after
transplantation
was
associated
with
hepatic
glutamine
synthetase
deficiency
in
two
patients
,
but
the
causal
relation
between
these
two
conditions
must
be
further
studied

Breastfed
infants
also
showed
greater
catch-up
growth
in
head
circumference
(
SD
score
(
SDS
)
0.53
higher
at
3
months
)
,
and
greater
body
length
gain
(
SDS
0.68
higher
at
6
months
)

Our
findings
suggest
that
breastfeeding
may
promote
faster
growth
in
infants
compromised
by
poor
growth
in
utero

SGA
infants
may
be
programmed
for
a
number
of
adverse
outcomes
;
the
possibility
that
such
events
are
altered
by
choice
of
postnatal
diet
is
a
key
issue
for
future
research

BACKGROUND
:
Few
studies
have
explored
the
health
practices
of
critical
care
nurses

Critical
care
nurses
routinely
teach
patients
about
using
healthy
practices
such
as
low-fat
diets
,
exercise
,
and
routine
screening
examinations

Nurses
are
selling
a
product
,
and
that
product
is
health

The
best
salespersons
are
those
who
are
genuinely
committed
to
their
product
and
model
its
benefits

Therefore
,
critical
care
nurses
'
healthful
practices
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
their
patients

OBJECTIVES
:
The
purpose
of
this
descriptive
exploratory
study
was
to
examine
critical
care
nurses
'
responses
to
three
questions
about
health
practices
in
their
daily
lives
:
(
1
)
What
are
critical
care
nurses
doing
currently
to
stay
healthy
?
(
2
)
Do
they
anticipate
making
any
changes
in
their
lifestyle
in
the
future
?
(
3
)
Would
they
recommend
their
lifestyle
to
their
patients
?
METHODS
:
One
hundred
twenty-seven
critical
care
nurses
attending
a
midwestern
critical
care
conference
completed
a
two-part
questionnaire
designed
to
produce
a
health
profile

In
a
man-on-the-street
approach
,
23
nurses
participated
in
an
interview
via
video
camera

Interviews
were
transcribed
verbatim
and
analyzed
for
themes
with
a
constant
comparative
method

Five
themes
emerged
from
the
videotaped
interviews
:
(
1
)
Heart-healthy
practices
predominated
the
responses

(
4
)
The
nurses
had
a
positive
attitude
about
their
healthy
lifestyles
and
felt
optimistic
about
being
role
models
for
their
patients

(
5
)
Future
plans
were
either
singular
in
focus
or
limited
to
maintenance
of
current
health
habits

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
majority
of
the
nurses
reported
practicing
a
healthy
lifestyle
and
thought
that
they
were
good
role
models
for
patients

Cytochrome
P450
1A1
(
CYP1A1
)
and
glutathione
S-transferase
M1
(
GSTM1
)
genetic
polymorphisms
are
involved
in
the
activation
and
detoxification
of
chemical
carcinogens
found
in
tobacco
smoke
;
thus
they
may
influence
host
susceptibility
to
lung
cancer

In
this
study
at
Massachusetts
General
Hospital
(
Boston
,
MA
,
USA
)
of
416
cases
and
446
controls
(
mostly
White
)
we
evaluated
the
association
between
the
CYP1A1
MspI
and
GSTM1
polymorphisms
and
lung
cancer
risk
,
and
their
interaction
with
cigarette
smoke

After
adjusting
for
age
,
gender
,
pack-years
of
smoking
,
and
years
since
quitting
smoking
,
while
neither
the
CYP1A1
MspI
heterozygous
genotype
alone
nor
the
GSTM1
null
genotype
alone
were
associated
with
a
significant
increase
in
lung
cancer
risk
,
having
both
genetic
traits
was
associated
with
a
twofold
increase
in
risk
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
(
CI
)
=
1.0-3.4
)

Our
data
did
not
provide
enough
evidence
for
a
substantial
modification
of
the
effect
of
pack-years
on
lung
cancer
risk
by
the
CYP1A1
MspI
and
GSTM1
genotypes

However
,
limitations
of
our
study
preclude
a
conclusion
about
this
potential
interaction

However
,
the
association
between
these
favorable
effects
and
the
clinical
outcome
of
patients
who
have
no
severe
hemodynamic
compromise
at
presentation
remains
unknown

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
The
present
multicenter
registry
included
719
consecutive
patients
with
major
pulmonary
embolism
according
to
clinical
,
echocardiographic
,
scintigraphic
,
and
cardiac
catheterization
criteria

All
patients
were
hemodynamically
stable
(
ie
,
without
evidence
of
cardiogenic
shock
)
at
presentation

treatment
(
within
24
hours
of
diagnosis
)
was
given
to
169
patients
(
23.5
%
)
,
whereas
the
remaining
550
patients
were
initially
treated
with
heparin
alone

Overall
30-day
mortality
was
significantly
lower
in
the
patients
who
received
thrombolytic
agents
(
4.7
versus
11.1
%
,
P=.016
)

<
TO_SEE
>
Patients
who
underwent
early
thrombolytic
treatment
had
a
reduced
rate
of
recurrent
pulmonary
embolism
(
7.7
versus
18.7
%
,
P
&
#
60
;
.001
)
but
also
a
higher
frequency
of
major
bleeding
episodes
(
21.9
%
versus
7.8
%
,
P
&
#
60
;
.001
)

Cerebral
bleeding
occurred
in
2
patients
in
each
treatment
group
,
and
1
patient
in
each
group
died
of
a
bleeding
complication

CONCLUSIONS
:
The
results
of
our
study
suggest
that
thrombolysis
may
favorably
affect
the
clinical
outcome
of
hemodynamically
stable
patients
with
major
pulmonary
embolism

He
was
followed
regularly
with
chest
computed
tomography
(
CT
)
scan
and
had
been
asymptomatic

During
one
of
his
physical
examinations
,
routine
sigmoidoscopy
showed
incidental
colonic
polyps
which
were
biopsied

Subsequently
,
recurrence
of
pleural
mesothelioma
and
peritoneal
involvement
by
mesothelioma
was
documented

Two
of
the
polyps
showed
metastatic
malignant
mesothelioma
in
the
lamina
propia
which
strongly
resembled
adenocarcinoma
histologically
causing
difficulty
in
making
definitive
diagnosis

This
case
shows
the
importance
of
clinical
history
and
ancillary
laboratory
procedures
such
as
immunohistochemistry
and
electron
microscopy
to
avoid
diagnostic
pitfalls

The
authors
report
the
postoperative
magnetic
resonance
(
MR
)
imaging
findings
in
36
patients
with
advanced
Parkinson
's
disease
who
underwent
unilateral
microelectrode-guided
posteroventral
pallidotomy

The
lesions
were
placed
within
1
mm
of
the
ventral
border
of
the
globus
pallidus
internus
(
GPi
)
to
include
pallidothalamic
outflow
pathways

Sequential
MR
studies
were
obtained
within
1
to
3
days
postoperatively
and
at
6-month
follow-up
examination

Transient
side
effects
occurred
in
five
patients
(
14
%
)
,
but
there
were
no
persistent
complications

The
mean
volume
of
the
middle
zone
,
corresponding
to
the
area
of
hemorrhagic
coagulation
necrosis
,
was
44.4
+/-
17.6
mm3
;
the
mean
lesion
volume
as
defined
by
the
outer
zone
,
corresponding
to
perilesional
edema
,
was
262.2
+/-
111.6
mm3

In
two
patients
small
ischemic
infarctions
involving
the
corona
radiata
were
found
,
and
in
one
a
venous
infarction
was
detected

Ischemic
infarction
resulted
in
mild
transient
Broca
's
aphasia
in
one
patient
,
but
there
was
no
detectable
neurological
deficit
in
the
other
two

The
mean
volume
of
late-phase
(
6
months
)
lesions
was
22
+/-
28.8
mm3

Lesioning
of
pallidal
and
subpallidal
pathways
may
contribute
to
the
sustained
clinical
benefit
in
this
series

Magnetic
resonance
imaging
analysis
showed
that
intraoperative
microelectrode
recording
facilitated
accurate
placement
of
the
lesion
in
this
critical
area

A
commercially
available
health
food
product
of
cold-pressed
hemp
seed
oil
ingested
by
one
volunteer
twice
a
day
for
4
1/2
days
(
135
mL
total
)

Urine
specimens
collected
from
the
volunteer
were
subjected
to
standard
workplace
urine
drug
testing
procedures
,
and
the
following
concentrations
of
11-nor-delta9-
tetrahydrocannabinol
carboxylic
acid
(
9-THCA
)
were
detected
:
41
ng/mL
9-THCA
at
45
h
,
49
ng/mL
at
69
h
,
and
55
ng/mL
at
93
h.
Ingestion
was
discontinued
after
93
h
,
and
the
following
concentrations
were
detected
:
68
ng/mL
at
108
h
,
57
ng/mL
at
117
h
,
31
ng/mL
at
126
h
,
and
20
ng/mL
at
142
h.
The
first
specimen
that
tested
negative
(
50
ng/mL
initial
immunoassay
test
,
15
ng/mL
confirmatory
gas
chromatographic-mass
spectrometric
test
)
was
at
146
h
,
which
was
53
h
after
the
last
hemp
seed
oil
ingestion

Four
subsequent
specimens
taken
to
177
h
were
also
negative

This
study
indicates
that
a
workplace
urine
drug
test
positive
for
cannabinoids
may
arise
from
the
consumption
of
commercially
available
cold-pressed
hemp
seed
oil

METHODS
:
BAEP
studies
were
performed
before
discharge
in
infants
treated
with
extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation
(
ECMO
)
,
and
two
specific
abnormalities
were
analyzed
:
elevated
threshold
and
delayed
central
auditory
conduction

The
sensitivity
and
specificity
of
an
elevated
threshold
on
the
neonatal
BAEP
for
detecting
subsequent
hearing
loss
,
and
the
relationship
of
any
neonatal
BAEP
abnormality
to
language
or
developmental
disorders
in
infancy
,
were
calculated

RESULTS
:
Test
results
for
46
ECMO-treated
infants
(
57.5
%
)
were
normal
,
and
those
for
34
infants
(
42.5
%
)
were
abnormal
,
with
either
elevated
wave
V
threshold
,
prolonged
wave
I-V
interval
,
or
both
on
neonatal
BAEP
recordings

Most
significantly
,
7
(
58
%
)
of
the
12
children
with
subsequent
sensorineural
hearing
loss
had
left
the
hospital
after
showing
normal
results
on
threshold
tests

There
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
frequency
of
hearing
loss
between
subjects
with
abnormal
(
5/21
,
or
24
%
)
and
those
with
normal
BAEP
thresholds
(
7/59
,
or
12
%
;
Fisher
Exact
Test
,
p
=
0.28
)

Neonatal
BAEP
specificity
for
excluding
subsequent
hearing
loss
was
76
%

Of
these
children
,
12
(
63
%
)
had
abnormal
neonatal
BAEP
recordings
and
7
(
37
%
)
had
a
normal
BAEP
threshold
,
normal
central
auditory
conduction
test
results
,
or
both
(
p
=
0.04
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
Neonatal
BAEP
threshold
recordings
were
of
limited
value
for
predicting
subsequent
hearing
loss
common
in
ECMO
-treated
survivors

However
,
an
abnormal
neonatal
BAEP
significantly
increased
the
probability
of
finding
a
receptive
language
delay
during
early
childhood
,
even
in
those
with
subsequently
normal
audiometry
findings

The
Federated
Council
of
Internal
Medicine
has
developed
a
resource
guide
to
help
internal
medicine
residency
programs
produce
internists
who
are
prepared
for
today
's
practice
of
internal
medicine
and
the
challenges
of
practice
in
the
future

The
guide
situates
general
internal
medicine
as
the
primary
care
profession
that
focuses
on
preventive
,
short-term
,
and
long-term
care
of
adult
patients

It
identifies
the
learning
experiences
that
should
be
part
of
general
internal
medicine
residency
training
,
lists
the
clinical
competencies
that
are
important
for
primary
care
practice
,
and
describes
the
role
of
the
integrative
disciplines
that
should
inform
the
care
of
every
patient

It
also
describes
a
process
that
program
directors
and
local
program
committees
can
use
to
develop
competency-based
curricula

We
report
4
new
cases
of
localized
Darier
disease
and
review
the
English-language
literature

OBSERVATIONS
:
Localized
Darier
disease
occurred
with
equal
frequency
in
males
and
females

The
most
frequent
site
of
involvement
was
the
trunk
(
40
%
(
16/40
)
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
Many
of
the
clinical
features
of
localized
Darier
disease
suggest
that
it
is
a
genetic
mosaic
of
generalized
Darier
disease

UV
radiation
induces
two
major
DNA
damage
products
,
the
cyclobutane
pyrimidine
dimer
(
CPD
)
and
,
at
a
lower
frequency
,
the
pyrimidine
(
6-4
)
pyrimidinone
dimer
(
6-4
product
)

Although
Escherichia
coli
and
Saccharomyes
cerevisiae
produce
a
CPD-specific
photolyase
that
eliminates
only
this
class
of
dimer
,
Arabidopsis
thaliana
,
Drosphila
melanogaster
,
Crotalus
atrox
,
and
Xenopus
laevis
have
recently
been
shown
to
photoreactivate
both
CPDs
and
6-4
products

We
describe
the
isolation
and
characterization
of
two
new
classes
of
mutants
of
Arabidopsis
,
termed
uvr2
and
uvr3
,
that
are
defective
in
the
photoreactivation
of
CPDs
and
6-4
products
,
respectively

We
demonstrate
that
the
CPD
photolyase
mutation
is
genetically
linked
to
a
DNA
sequence
encoding
a
type
II
(
metazoan
)
CPD
photolyase

This
provides
us
with
a
unique
opportunity
to
study
the
biological
consequences
of
each
of
these
two
major
UV-induced
photoproducts
in
an
intact
living
system

A
diffuse
macular
erythroderma
and
subsequent
desquamation
after
1
to
2
weeks
are
two
of
the
five
major
diagnostic
criteria
of
toxic
shock
syndrome
(
TSS
)

We
present
the
case
of
a
15-month-old
girl
with
TSS
,
but
without
erythroderma
or
desquamation

She
was
admitted
with
high
fever
,
shock
,
and
multiorgan
involvement

Initially
the
diagnosis
of
the
syndrome
of
hemorrhagic
shock
and
encephalopathy
was
made

After
7
days
,
a
TSS
toxin
1-producing
strain
of
Staphylococcus
aureus
was
cultured
from
an
inguinal
lymph
node
,
where
inflammation
had
already
been
noticed
on
admission

We
conclude
that
the
patient
had
TSS
without
rash

Without
the
evidence
implicating
a
TSS
toxin
1-producing
strain
of
S.
aureus
as
the
cause
of
her
disease
,
a
diagnosis
of
syndrome
of
hemorrhagic
shock
and
encephalopathy
would
have
been
made

BACKGROUND
:
The
growing
teratoma
syndrome
refers
to
the
phenomenon
whereby
germ
cell
tumors
enlarge
after
chemotherapy
despite
complete
eradication
of
malignant
cells
and
normalization
of
serum
tumor
markers

This
clinical
scenario
must
be
differentiated
from
that
in
which
germ
cell
tumors
maintain
their
malignant
characteristics
with
elevated
levels
of
serum
tumor
markers

METHODS
:
Hospital
record
review
was
conducted
of
2
cases

RESULTS
:
Two
male
patients
are
presented
,
1
with
a
metastatic
germ
cell
tumor
of
both
the
retroperitoneum
and
mediastinum
(
with
elevated
alpha-fetoprotein
level
)
and
1
with
a
primary
germ
cell
tumor
of
the
mediastinum
(
with
elevated
alpha-fetoprotein
and
beta-human
chorionic
gonadotropin
levels
)

The
clinical
and
roentgenographic
features
of
patients
with
thoracic
manifestations
of
the
growing
teratoma
syndrome
,
as
well
as
its
management
,
are
reviewed

CONCLUSIONS
:
After
chemotherapy
in
patients
with
primary
or
metastatic
mediastinal
germ
cell
tumors
whose
tumor
markers
normalize
,
a
growing
mass
in
the
mediastinum
may
represent
the
growing
teratoma
syndrome

Expression
of
the
CaMI
gene
was
detected
in
all
chicken
tissues
examined
,
although
at
varying
levels

Our
results
demonstrate
that
the
``
multigene-one-protein
''
principle
of
CaM
synthesis
is
not
only
applicable
to
mammals
whose
CaM
is
encoded
by
three
different
genes
,
but
also
to
chickens

BACKGROUND
:
We
assessed
the
accuracy
of
two
electron
beam
computed
tomography
(
EBCT
)
protocols
for
predicting
coronary
events

METHODS
AND
RESULTS
:
In
1994
,
24
months
after
enrollment
in
a
longitudinal
study
,
326
high-risk
adults
underwent
both
3-
and
6-mm
image-slice
thickness
EBCT
scanning
and
were
followed
up
for
32.0+/-4.0
additional
months

Events
were
defined
as
either
coronary
death
,
myocardial
infarction
,
or
revascularization

We
monitored
these
subjects
for
the
32-month
postscanning
period
with
yearly
phone
calls
and
acquisition
of
records
for
all
hospital
admissions

At
the
time
of
scanning
,
11
subjects
(
3
%
)
had
already
suffered
12
events
(
5
infarctions
and
7
revascularizations
)
during
the
24-month
prescanning
period

During
the
postscanning
period
,
18
subjects
(
6
%
)
suffered
23
events
(
5
coronary
deaths
,
6
infarctions
,
and
12
revascularizations
)

Thus
,
28
subjects
(
9
%
)
suffered
35
events

Calcium
quantities
calculated
for
both
protocols
,
performed
on
the
same
subjects
,
were
sorted
in
ascending
order
and
divided
into
equal
quartiles

These
relationships
were
preserved
in
the
subjects
without
prior
events
at
the
time
of
scanning

Coronary
calcium
amount
appears
to
be
a
weak
predictor
of
coronary
death
and
infarction

Its
predictive
accuracy
is
superior
for
predicting
revascularization

Research
into
the
genetic
component
of
some
complex
behaviors
often
causes
controversy
,
depending
on
the
social
meaning
and
significance
of
the
behavior
under
study

This
research
is
worrisome
for
many
reasons
,
including
the
fact
that
it
has
been
used
to
harm
lesbians
and
gay
men

Other
chose
to
undergo
them
to
escape
discrimination
and
social
disapprobation

The
very
motivation
for
seeking
an
``
origin
''
of
homosexuality
reveals
homophobia

Moreover
,
such
research
may
lead
to
prenatal
tests
that
claim
to
predict
for
homosexuality

For
homosexual
people
who
live
in
countries
with
no
legal
protections
these
dangers
are
particularly
serious

All
patients
underwent
TEFNA
and
TESE
consecutively

Thus
,
each
patient
served
as
his
own
control

The
case
was
regarded
as
successful
if
at
least
one
testicular
spermatozoon
was
found
allowing
intracytoplasmic
sperm
injection
(
ICSI
)
of
at
least
one
oocyte

Whereas
by
TEFNA
spermatozoa
enabling
performance
of
ICSI
were
found
in
only
four
patients
out
of
37
(
11
%
)
,
open
biopsy
and
TESE
yielded
spermatozoa
in
16
cases
(
43
%
)

Performance
of
ICSI
with
testicular
sperm
in
these
cases
resulted
in
satisfactory
fertilization
and
high
embryo
transfer
rates

Cyclin
D1
,
the
regulatory
subunit
of
certain
protein
kinases
thought
to
advance
the
G1
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
,
is
now
established
as
a
proto-oncogene
,
with
evidence
indicating
that
its
derangement
may
contribute
to
the
uncontrolled
cell
growth
characteristic
of
tumors

The
chromosomal
translocation
t
(
11
;
14
)
(
q13
:
q32
)
,
involving
rearrangement
of
the
BCL-1
locus
,
is
closely
associated
with
human
lymphoid
neoplasia
affecting
mantle
cell
lymphomas
(
MCL
)

Of
note
,
all
of
the
known
break
points
leave
the
cyclin
D1
coding
region
structurally
intact
and
result
in
increased
protein
expression
,
implying
that
this
may
provide
a
highly
sensitive
and
specific
marker
for
MCL

Recent
studies
demonstrated
that
immunohistochemical
detection
in
paraffin-embedded
material
,
using
a
monoclonal
antibody
,
is
very
useful
for
routine
diagnosis

Current
knowledge
of
cyclin
D1
overexpression
in
malignant
lymphomas
,
with
emphasis
on
its
clinicopathologic
significance
,
is
reviewed

In
the
mammalian
central
nervous
system
,
a
diverse
group
of
basic
helix-loop-helix
(
bHLH
)
proteins
is
involved
in
the
determination
of
progenitor
cells
and
,
subsequently
,
in
regulating
neuronal
differentiation

Here
we
report
the
identification
of
a
novel
subfamily
of
bHLH
proteins
,
defined
by
two
mammalian
enhancer-of-split-
and
hairy-related
proteins
,
termed
SHARP-1
and
SHARP-2

In
contrast
to
known
bHLH
genes
,
detectable
transcription
of
SHARP
genes
begins
at
the
end
of
embryonic
development
marking
differentiated
neurons
that
have
reached
a
final
position
,
and
increases
as
postnatal
development
proceeds

In
the
adult
,
SHARP
genes
are
expressed
in
subregions
of
the
CNS
that
have
been
associated
with
adult
plasticity

Similarly
,
within
1
h
after
the
administration
of
kainic
acid
in
vivo
,
SHARP-2
is
induced
in
neurons
throughout
the
rat
cerebral
cortex

This
suggests
that
neuronal
bHLH
proteins
are
also
involved
in
the
``
adaptive
''
changes
of
mature
CNS
neurons
which
are
coupled
to
glutamatergic
stimulation

In
the
present
study
we
recall
the
particular
aspects
of
the
neurulation
in
the
cephalic
area
,
then
the
establishment
of
the
facial
processes

After
is
considered
constitution
and
natured
of
the
prechordal
plate
which
has
been
diversely
explained

Finally
,
the
modelling
of
the
face
is
evocated
,
in
which
the
dissociation
between
the
olfactive
and
buccal
spheres
is
pointed
out
,
with
the
disparition
of
the
muzzle
,
as
it
is
established
in
the
haplorhinae
,
a
class
of
primates
in
which
the
human
being
is
involved

This
phenomenon
raises
different
questions
,
in
particular
about
the
relation
of
this
disposition
with
the
nasoseptal
center
,
the
medial
part
of
the
nasodorsal
center

Blood
samples
were
taken
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
of
preeclampsia
and
at
comparable
gestational
ages
for
matched
normal
controls

A
discriminant
score
of
>
or
=
275
indicated
a
>
or
=
90
%
probability
of
preeclampsia

Further
prospective
studies
are
warranted
to
test
the
efficacy
of
this
discriminant
function
in
predicting
preeclampsia

A
novel
technique
for
patterning
immobilized
antibody
layers
based
upon
photolithography
and
oxygen
plasma
exposure
has
been
developed

Photolithographic
patterning
was
performed
with
a
positive
photoresist
with
modified
bake
temperatures
and
times
,
selective
UV
exposure
with
a
contact
mask
,
and
aqueous
alkaline
solubilization
of
exposed
resist

Residual
resist
was
stripped
with
acetone

Successful
patterning
was
demonstrated
by
challenging
surfaces
with
goat
anti-mouse
antibody
conjugated
to
tetramethylrhodamine
isothiocyanate

Sucrose
stabilization
was
necessary
for
antibody
to
undergo
photoresist
processing
without
loss
of
binding
activity

Immune
cells
in
vivo
routinely
perform
highly
selective
immunosensing
in
blood
and
tissues
as
part
of
their
normal
immune
surveillance
functions

We
have
been
investigating
the
potential
of
exploiting
the
immunosensing
detection
abilities
of
excitable
immune
cells
(
i.e
.
the
mast
cell
)
for
the
development
of
whole
cell
immunobiosensors

In
the
presence
of
antigen
,
these
cells
undergo
excitable
activation
responses
which
result
in
increased
metabolism
and
the
exocytosis
of
stored
intracellular
mediators

In
this
work
we
investigated
the
use
of
enzyme
amplification
systems
to
enhance
the
direct
transduction
of
immune
cell
responses
to
analyte

It
was
found
that
with
appropriate
enzymes
,
peak
outputs
occurred
within
approximately
5
min
(
4-20
times
faster
than
without
enzymes
)
and
peak
response
magnitudes
were
up
to
nine-fold
greater
than
without
enzymes

An
easy-to-use
technique
for
detection
of
antibodies
specific
for
the
parasite
L.
donovani
in
human
serum
sample
has
been
developed

Treated
fibres
are
incubated
with
the
patient
serum
for
10
min
followed
by
incubation
with
goat
anti
human
IgG
tagged
FITC

Also
,
no
false
positive
result
was
obtained
with
serum
samples
of
patients
infected
with
leprosy
,
tuberculosis
,
typhoid
and
malaria
,
showing
the
specificity
of
the
sensor
and
efficacy
of
the
technique

We
present
an
optical
biosensor
design
that
expands
the
utility
of
enzyme
biosensors

These
biosensors
are
fabricated
by
site-selective
photodeposition
of
analyte-sensitive
polymer
matrices
on
optical
imaging
fibres

These
dual-analyte
arrays
allow
for
the
simultaneous
,
independent
measurement
of
the
analyte
of
interest
and
the
transducing
analyte

The
first
integrated
optical-biosensors
using
this
design
have
been
prepared
that
allow
both
the
dependent
and
independent
analytes
to
be
measured
simultaneously
,
for
example
penicillin
and
pH
(
Healey
&
#
38
;
Walt
,
1995
)
or
glucose
and
O2
(
Li
&
#
38
;
Walt
,
1995
)

Independent
measurement
of
the
transducing
analyte
allows
penicillin
or
glucose
to
be
quantitated
in
the
presence
of
a
concurrent
pH
or
O2
change
,
respectively

Penicillin
can
be
measured
in
the
range
0.25-10.0
mM
in
the
pH
range
6.2-7.5

Glucose
can
be
measured
in
the
range
0.6-20.0
mM
in
the
O2
range
20-100
%

The
utility
of
the
sensor
design
was
demonstrated
by
using
the
penicillin-dual-analyte
biosensor
to
quantitate
penicillin
produced
during
a
Penicillium
chrysogenum
fermentation

The
characterization
of
low
molecular
weight
ligand
interaction
with
receptor
molecules
is
of
importance
for
the
investigation
of
biological
processes
and
for
drug
research

We
report
on
the
investigation
of
the
binding
of
low
molecular
weight
ligands
to
immobilized
receptors
by
label-free
detection

Reflectometric
interference
spectroscopy
,
an
optical
transducer
which
allows
the
monitoring
of
a
few
picograms
per
square
millimetre
changes
in
surface
coverage
,
was
used
to
study
two
model
systems

In
both
cases
detection
of
the
binding
event
was
successful

High
affinity
binding
of
biotin
to
immobilized
streptavidin
was
clearly
detectable
at
receptor
surface
concentrations
as
low
as
1-2
x
10
(
10
)
binding
sites/mm2

Linear
correlation
between
the
receptor
surface
concentration
and
the
response
to
biotin
binding
was
observed

Using
immobilized
DNA
,
we
investigated
the
binding
of
common
intercalators
with
respect
to
kinetics
and
thermodynamics
by
evaluation
of
the
association
and
the
dissociation
part
of
the
binding
curve

Bi-exponential
increase
and
decrease
of
intercalator
loading
was
observed
,
indicating
complex
interaction
kinetics

Improvement
of
experimental
parameters
is
required
to
obtain
more
reliable
kinetic
data

An
amperometric
lactate
oxidase
catheter
has
been
developed
for
in

application
to
real-time
lactate
monitoring

The
electrochemical
behaviour
of
the
1
x
3
mm
Pt-Ag/AgCl
thin
film
electrode
is
not
significantly
influenced
by
lactate
oxidase-polyurethane
covering

Gamma-irradiation
(
25
kGy
)
is
suitable
for
the
sterilization
procedure

The
final
lactate
catheter
is
characterized
by
a
linear
concentration
range
between
0.5
and
20
mmol/l
lactate
with
a
sensitivity
around
2
nA

Ex

whole

using

of

(

Lactate

obtained
by
continuous

operation
ex

correlate
well
with
those
obtained
by
BIOSEN

First

underlines
the

The
diffusion-limited
binding
kinetics
of
antigen
(
or
antibody
)
in
solution
to
antibody
(
or
antigen
)
immobilized
on
a
biosensor
and
other
surfaces
is
analyzed
within
a
fractal
framework

In
some
cases
,
the
binding
curve
exhibits
complexities

Then
,
for
these
cases
,
the
dual-fractal
analysis
provides
an
improved
fit
when
compared
with
a
single-fractal
analysis

This
indicates
a
change
in
the
reaction
mechanism
on
the
surface

For
example
,
for
the
binding
of
10
nM
insulin
growth
factor-1
in
solution
to
insulin
growth
factor
binding
protein-1
immobilized
on
a
biosensor
surface
,
a
64
%
increase
in
the
fractal
dimension
from
1.73
(
Df1
)
to
2.85
(
Df2
)
leads
to
an
increase
in
the
binding
rate
coefficient
by
a
factor
of
31.8
from
3.92
(
k1
)
to
125
(
k2
)

Furthermore
,
as
the
IGF-1
concentration
in
solution
increases
from
10
to
80
nM
in
solution
,
k2
and
Df2
exhibit
a
linear
increase

k1
and
Df1
exhibit
a
linear
increase
with
the
reciprocal
of
the
IGF-1
concentration
in
solution

The
different
examples
analyzed
and
presented
together
provide
a
means
by
which
the
antigen-antibody
reactions
may
be
better
controlled
by
noting
the
magnitude
of
the
changes
in
the
fractal
dimension
and
in
the
binding
rate
coefficient
as
the
reaction
progresses
on
the
biosensor
surface

This
may
be
one
method
to
help
manipulate
or
control
the
binding
rate
coefficients
on
the
reaction
surface

To
determine
if
microscopic
urinalysis
is
needed
in
all
pediatric
emergency
room
patients
screened
for
urinary
tract
infections
(
UTI
)
,
we
compared
the
dipstick
urinalysis
and
complete
urinalysis
(
dipstick
and
microscopy
)
with
urine
cultures
in
236
children
,
aged
3
weeks
to
21
years

The
ability
to
detect
UTI
by
dipstick
only
and
by
complete
urinalysis
was
the
same
,
however
microscopic
evaluation
added
many
false-positive
results
without
detecting
additional
UTIs

Because
the
ability
to
detect
UTI
(
sensitivity
)
is
maintained
,
we
now
offer
a
dipstick
only
urinalysis
to
our
emergency
room
for
children
2
years
of
age
or
older
,
with
a
microscopic
analysis
performed
automatically
if
dipstick
results
are
positive

Using
video-intensified
fluorescence
microscopy
and
a
pseudocolor
display
of
fluorescence
intensity
,
we
analyzed
the
distribution
of
microinjected
molecules
within
the
nurse-cell/oocyte
syncytium
of
Drosophila
ovarian
follicles

We
varied
the
composition
and
the
osmolarity
of
the
culture
solution
as
well
as
the
electrical
charge
and
the
molecular
mass
of
the
microinjected
fluorescent
probe

As
culture
solutions
,
we
used
four
simple
salines
(
IMADS
)
and
a
complex
tissue-culture
medium
(
R-14
)
that
matched
the
osmolarity
of
adult
hemolymph

Small
amounts
of
two
anionic
dyes
(
Lucifer
Yellow
CH
and
Lucifer
Yellow
dextran
)
as
well
as
of
two
cationic
dyes
(
rhodamine
6G
and
tetramethylrhodamine
dextran-lysine
)
were
iontophoretically
microinjected
either
into
a
nurse
cell
or
into
the
oocyte
of
stage-10
follicles

In
the
tissue-culture
medium
,
within
a
few
seconds
following
microinjection
,
all
tested
dyes
passed
through
the
intercellular
bridges
in
both
the
anterior
direction
(
to
the
nurse
cells
)
and
the
posterior
direction
(
to
the
oocyte
)
,
independent
of
their
electrical
charge
or
molecular
mass

Our
results
indicate
that
the
electrical
gradient
described
by
other
authors
does
not
exert
significant
influence
on
the
migration
of
charged
molecules
through
intercellular
bridges
in
situ

The
gene
contains
two
alternative
first
exons
,
1a
and
1b
,
both
including
a
translation
initiation
codon

The
translocation
breakpoint
cluster
region
is
flanked
by
exons
3
and
6
and
two
different
polyadenylation
signals
were
identified

In
mitogen-stimulated
human
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
the
AF-4
antigen
was
predominantly
located
in
the
nucleus

The
AF-4
gene
is
a
member
of
the
AF-4
,
LAF-4
and
FMR-2
gene
family

The
members
of
this
family
encode
serine-proline-rich
proteins
with
properties
of
nuclear
transcription
factors

Immunoglobulin
superfamily
molecules
in
the
brain
are
involved
in
distinct
aspects
of
nervous
system
histogenesis
,
for
example
neuronal
migration
and
axonal
growth

To
identify
novel
members
of
this
superfamily
in
the
chick
nervous
system
,
we
developed
a
polymerase
chain
reaction-based
approach
making
use
of
sequence
motifs
of
immunoglobulin-like
domains

This
molecule
has
91
%
sequence
identity
with
the
limbic
system-associated
membrane
protein
(
LAMP
)
characterized
in
the
rat
and
is
therefore
referred
to
as
the
chicken
homologue
of
the
latter
(
chLAMP
)

The
molecule
is
a
glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored
60
kDa
protein
with
three
immunoglobulin-like
domains
and
contains
40
%
N-linked
carbohydrate

In
addition
,
we
demonstrate
using
a
fusion
protein
expressed
in
eukaryotic
cells
that
chLAMP
has
homophilic
binding
activity

The
protein
was
found
on
a
subset
of
axons
in
the
central
and
peripheral
nervous
system
and
is
likely
to
be
involved
in
specific
cell-cell
interactions
in
neurohistogenesis

DNAS1L2
is
located
on
a
16p13.3
cosmid
,
while
DNAS1L3
maps
to
3p14.3-p21.1
by
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
and
by
PCR
analysis
of
a
radiation
hybrid
panel

The
previously
defined
DNL1L
or
DNAS1L1
is
expressed
highest
in
heart
and
skeletal
muscle
,
while
DNase
I
is
expressed
in
the
pancreas
,
parotid
gland
,
and
kidney

A
comparison
of
DNAS1L1
,
DNAS1L2
,
and
DNAS1L3
with
the
well-characterized
DNase
I
suggests
that
the
DNAS1L
proteins
are
unlikely
to
be
glycosylated
or
bind
actin
;
however
,
catalytic
and
calcium-
and
DNA-binding
residues
are
conserved
,
and
potentially
cleavable
signal
peptides
are
present
among
all
these
proteins

This
analysis
also
identifies
regions
of
high
conservation
among
these
proteins
with
no
currently
assigned
function

Two
different
responses
to
the
therapy
were
observed
in
a
group
of
patients
receiving
the
protease
inhibitor
indinavir

In
one
,
suppression
of
virus
replication
occurred
and
has
persisted
for
90
weeks
(
bDNA
,
&
#

;
500
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type

(
HIV-1
)

)

In
the
six
patients
in
this
group
,
there
was
also
an
identical
mutation
in
the
gag
p7/p1
gag
protease
cleavage
site

In
three
of
the
patients
,
this
change
was
seen
as
early
as
6
to
10
weeks
after
the
start
of
therapy

In
one
patient
,
a
second
mutation
occurred
at
the
gag
p1/p6
cleavage
site
,
but
it
appeared
18
weeks
after
the
time
of
appearance
of
the
p7/p1
mutation

When
recombinant
HIV-1-containing
protease
mutations
at
46
and
82
was
grown
in
MT2
cells
,
there
was
a
68
%
reduction
in
its
rate
of
replication
compared
to
the
WT
virus

Similarly
,
rates
of
replication
of
viruses
with
mutations
M46L/I
,
I54V
,
and
V82A
in
protease
were
enhanced
both
in
the
presence
and
in
the
absence
of
Indinavir
when
combined
with
mutations
in
the
gag
p7/p1
and
the
gag
p1/p6
cleavage
sites

This
is
the
first
report
of
the
emergence
of
mutations
in
the

A
novel
intracellular
calcium-binding
protein
from
Echinococcus
granulosus
is
described
in
this
work

A
cDNA
was
isolated
from
a
lambdagt11
protoscolex
expression
library
and
the
deduced
amino
acid
sequence
has
at
least
fifteen
sequentially
repeated
twelve-residue
repeats
that
resemble
the
calcium-binding
loop
of
EF-hands
;
however
,
the
dodecamer
motif
has
no
flanking
helices

The
cDNA
was
expressed
in
Escherichia
coli
using
the
pGEX
vector
,
and
a
recombinant
fusion
protein
(
EgCaBP1-GST
)
was
obtained

The
recombinant
fusion
protein
binds
calcium
when
assayed
with
45Ca

It
is
possible
that
the
calcium-binding
motifs
present
a
secondary
structure
similar
to
the
parallel
beta
roll
structure
described
for
an
alkaline
protease
from
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa

A
native
protein
of
more
than
300
kDa
was
recognized
by
an
anti-EgCaBP1
monoclonal
antibody
by
Western-blot
analysis

Immunohistochemistry
using
a
pool
of
anti-EgCaBP1-GST
mouse
sera
demonstrated
a
strong
association
of
the
protein
with
calcareous
corpuscles

The
possible
role
of
this
protein
and
that
of
the
calcareous
corpuscles
in
the
protoscolex
are
discussed

The
enzyme
activity
of
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(
MAP
kinase
)
increases
in
response
to
agents
acting
on
a
variety
of
cell
surface
receptors
,
including
receptors
linked
to
heterotrimeric
G
proteins

In
this
report
,
we
demonstrated
that
Raf-1
protein
kinase
activity
in
the
mouse
parotid
glands
was
induced
by
chronic
isoproterenol
administration
in
whole
animals

To
investigate
the
molecular
nature
underlying
cellular
responses
to
Raf-1
activation
,
we
have
stably
transfected
rat
salivary
epithelial
Pa-4
cells
with
human
Raf-1-estrogen
receptor
fusion
gene
(
DeltaRaf-1
:
ER
)
and
used
mRNA
differential
display
in
search
of
messages
induced
by
DeltaRaf-1
:
ER
activation

Through
this
approach
,
the
gene
encoding
non-histone
chromosomal
protein
HMGI-C
was
identified
as
one
of
the
target
genes
activated
by
oncogenic
Raf-1
kinase

The
role
of
the
extracellular
signal-related
kinase
(
ERK
)
signaling
pathway
in
the
HMGI-C
induction
was
highlighted
by
the
result
that
the
MAP
kinase
kinase
(
MEK
)
inhibitor
,
PD
98059
,
blocked
DeltaRaf-1
:
ER-
and
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated
HMGI-C
induction

Altogether
,
these
findings
support
the
notion
that
the
Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling
module
,
at
least
in
part
,
regulates
transcriptional
activation
of
the
chromosomal
architectural
protein
HMGI-C

Pendred
syndrome
is
a
recessively
inherited
disorder
with
the
hallmark
features
of
congenital
deafness
and
thyroid
goitre

By
some
estimates
,
the
disorder
may
account
for
upwards
of
10
%
of
hereditary
deafness

Previous
genetic
linkage
studies
localized
the
gene
to
a
broad
interval
on
human
chromosome
7q22-31.1

Using
a
positional
cloning
strategy
,
we
have
identified
the
gene
(
PDS
)
mutated
in
Pendred
syndrome
and
found
three
apparently
deleterious
mutations
,
each
segregating
with
the
disease
in
the
respective
families
in
which
they
occur

PDS
produces
a
transcript
of
approximately
5
kb
that
was
found
to
be
expressed
at
significant
levels
only
in
the
thyroid

These
studies
provide
compelling
evidence
that
defects
in
pendrin
cause
Pendred
syndrome
thereby
launching
a
new
area
of
investigation
into
thyroid
physiology
,
the
pathogenesis
of
congenital
deafness
and
the
role
of
altered
sulphate
transport
in
human
disease

We
report
the
cDNA
cloning
,
partial
genomic
organization
,
and
expression
pattern
of
Stra10
,
a
novel
retinoic
acid-inducible
gene
in
P19
embryonal
carcinoma
cells

Four
murine
cDNA
isoforms
have
been
isolated
,
which
are
likely
to
result
from
alternative
splicing

The
predicted
protein
sequences
exhibit
approximately
85
%
identity
with
the
Pbx-related
Meis1
homeobox
gene
products
,
which
are
involved
in
myeloid
leukemia
in
BXH-2
mice
,
and
one
of
the
Stra10
isoforms
corresponds
to
the
recently
published
Meis2
sequence
(
Nakamura
et
al
.
(
1996
)
Oncogene
13
:
2235-2242
)

The
Meis2
homeodomain
is
identical
to
that
of
Meis1
,
and
is
most
closely
related
to
those
of
the
Pbx/TGIF
homeobox
gene
products

By
in
situ
hybridization
analysis
,
we
show
that
the
Meis2
gene
displays
spatially
restricted
expression
patterns
in
the
developing
nervous
system
,
limbs
,
face
,
and
in
various
viscera

In
adult
mice
,
Meis2
is
mainly
expressed
in
the
brain
and
female
genital
tract
,
with
a
different
distribution
of
the
alternative
splice
forms
in
these
organs

A
methodical
strategy
for
the
isolation
of
microsatellite
markers
specific
for
targeted
regions
of
bovine
chromosomes
is
presented

With
this
approach
,
a
library
specific
to
the
BTA
6q21-31
chromosomal
region
was
constructed

Eleven
unique
microsatellite-containing
sequences
were
isolated
,
converted
into
sequence-tagged
microsatellite
sites
,
and
characterized
concerning
their
species-specific
origin

Seven
primer
pairs
generated
bovine-specific
PCR
products
and
provided
a
set
of
microsatellite
markers
that
generally
revealed
high
informativity
in
the
HF
breed

The
results
underline
the
usefulness
of
the
BTA
6q21-31
library
for
targeted
isolation
of
unique
sequences
that
are
specific
for
the
dissected
chromosomal
region
as
demonstrated
here
by
the
isolation
of
microsatellite
markers

The
RFLP
analysis
revealed
13
haplotypes
which
showed
weak
geographical
patterning
consistent
with
a
recent
range
expansion
from
a
refugial
population
(
s
)

An
analysis
of
molecular
variance
(
AMOVA
)
revealed
no
correspondence
between
mtDNA
phylogeography
and
subspecies
delimitation
,
nor
between
matrilines
and
areas
characterized
by
a
high
incidence
of
the
viverrid-type
rabies
,
of
which
the
yellow
mongoose
is
the
principal
vector

The
lack
of
structure
was
also
shown
by
control
region
sequences
although
four
of
the
maternal
lineages
shared
a
near-perfect
81
bp
repeat

We
speculate
that
regional
hot
spots
of
the
viverrid
rabies
biotype
reflect
population
density
differences
in
the
yellow
mongoose
that
are
not
underscored
by
genetic
partitioning
,
at
least
at
the
level
of
resolution
provided
by
our
analyses

The
indoor
pollution
,
where
the
patients
pass
in
general
close
to
90
%
of
their
time
,
is
an
important
factor
to
take
in
consideration
if
one
wants
to
evaluate
suitably
the
effects
of
the
air
pollution
on
the
health

Causes
of
this
kind
of
pollution
are
partially
linked
to
the
external
pollution
and
the
outdoor
environment
and
also
are
function
of
human
activities
and
introduced
products
in
the
habitat
(
heating
,
tabagisme
,
handywork
,
products
of
maintenance
,
coatings
,
materials
of
construction
,
etc

)

The
effects
on
health
are
as
various
as
the
pollutants
,
going
from
sharp
intoxication
to
irritations
or
simply
desagreements

In
this
problem
of
public
health
we
may
not
underestimated
sensitive
persons
and
risky
group
as
well
as
long
terme
effects
,
and
chronic
exposition
effects

The
search
of
solutions
needs
multiple
competences
from
the
physician
,
who
has
to
play
an
essential
role

Dioxins
are
a
family
of
chlorinated
aromatic
hydrocarbons
that
are
produced
during
combustion
processes
in
the
presence
of
a
chlorine
donor
and
as
by-products
of
the
chlorine-processing
chemical
industries

Several
dioxins
are
extremely
stable
compounds
and
persist
for
years
in
the
environment

Exposure
to
dioxins
occurs
mainly
via
the
ingestion
of
contaminated
food

The
mechanisms
of
dioxin
action
are
similar
to
those
of
a
hormone

Dioxins
bind
to
a
specific
intracellular
receptor
and
the
complex
acts
as
a
transcription
factor
that
induces
the
production
of
a
great
number
of
proteins

Certain
dioxins
,
particularly
2
,
3
,
7
,
8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
,
are
very
toxic
and
able
to
induce
numerous
clinical
conditions

The
carcinogenicity
of
dioxins
is
well
documented
in
animal
models
and
has
been
described
in
humans
after
professional
and
accidental
exposures

The
particular
sensibility
of
the
fetus
and
newborn
is
of
concern
because
the
exposition
to
dioxins
is
particularly
important
during
those
periods
of
life

In
humans
a
series
of
conditions
related
to
hormonal
dysfunction
as
undescended
testis
,
decreased
spermatogenesis
,
testicular
cancer
and
endometriosis
have
increased
in
incidence
during
the
last
decades

The
chronological
parallelism
with
the
appearance
of
dioxins
in
the
environment
suggests
that
these
might
exert
biological
effects
at
the
prevailing
level
of
exposure

Nevertheless
this
hypothesis
is
currently
unconfirmed
by
epidemiological
studies

The
implications
of
this
scientific
incertitude
for
the
implementation
of
preventive
measures
are
briefly
discussed

This
presentation
summarizes
the
debate
on
the
suggested
progressive
impairment
of
semen
quality
(
the
``
sperm
fall
''
)
in
the
last
forty
years
in
the
developed
countries

The
various
available
data
strongly
suggesting
an
environmental
toxic
origin
for
the
``
sperm
fall
''
will
be
presented
as
well
as
the
most
frequently
suspected
class
of
substances
,
the
xenoestrogens

Diabetes
mellitus
is
a
still
growing
disease

The
treatment
of
diabetes
2
by
the
classic
oral
antidiabetic
drugs
(
sulfamides
and
biguanides
)
is
completed
by
intestinal
glycosidases
inhibitors
and
thiazolidendiones

Recent
intervention
studies
have
demonstrated
the
necessity
to
treat
vigorously
dysipidemias

Despite
Beta-blockade
therapy
has
been
considered
as
an
absolute
contraindication
in
the
treatment
of
heart
failure
,
it
has
been
shown
that
they
could
have
a
beneficial
effect
,
provided
that
they
were
introduced
at
very
low
dose
,
and
very
progressively
in
addition
of
the
traditional
treatment

The
advances
in
the
understanding
of
the
neuro-hormonal
mechanisms
of
heart
failure
have
modified
the
therapeutic
strategy
:
the
deleterious
effect
of
the
activation
of
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
on
the
myocardium
has
served
as
the
rationale
for
randomized
clinical
trials
comparing
beta-blockade
to
placebo
:
the
current
data
are
promising
,
suggesting
a
beneficial
effect
on
survival
as
well
as
on
quality
of
life

Calcium
antagonists
have
been
used
for
treatment
of
cardiovascular
diseases
for
more
than
25
years

Several
recent
retrospective
studies
have
suggested
that
chronic
treatment
with
short-acting
dihydropyridines
increased
the
incidence
of
cardiac
events
,
cancer
and
gastrointestinal
bleedings

Randomized
prospective
studies
have
,
however
,
never
been
able
to
confirm
these
observations

In
addition
,
well-conducted
studies
using
verapamil
and
diltiazem
have
suggested
that
these
calcium
antagonists
may
even
improve
cardiovascular
mortality
and
morbidity
of
the
hypertensive
patient

<
TO_SEE
>
There
is
therefore
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
questionable
results
derived
from
retrospective
studies
of
the
effects
of
short-acting
calcium
antagonists
on
cardiac
and
noncardiac
events
may
apply
to
the
newer
generation
of
long-acting
calcium
antagonists

These
drugs
are
very
efficacious
and
generally
devoided
of
important
side
effects
,
but
they
are
expensive
and
therefore
have
to
be
compared
with
other
,
more
conventional
drugs
with
established
or
assumed
efficacy

We

Fiercer
competition
between
athletes
and
a
wider
knowledge
of
optimal
training
regimens
dramatically
influence
current
training
methods

Positive
overtraining
can
be
regarded
as
a
natural
process
when
the
end
result
is
adaptation
and
improved
performance
:
the
supercompensation
principle
--
which
includes
the
breakdown
process
(
training
)
followed
by
the
recovery
process
(
rest
)
--
is
well
known
in
sports

However
,
psychological
testing
may
reveal
early-warning
signs
more
readily
than
the
various
physiological
or
immunological
markers

An
athlete
failing
to
recover
within
72
hours
has
presumably
negatively
overtrained
and
is
in
an
overreached
state

There
are
many
methods
used
to
measure
the
training
process
but
few
with
which
to
match
the
recovery
process
against
it

Furthermore
,
directing
attention
to
psychophysiological
cues
serves
the
same
purpose
as
in
RPE
,
i.e
.
increasing
self-awareness

This
article
reviews
and
conceptualises
the
whole
overtraining
process

In
doing
so
,
it
(
i
)
aims
to
differentiate
between
the
types
of
stress
affecting
an
athlete
's
performance
:
(
ii
)
identifies
factors
influencing
an
athlete
's
ability
to
adapt
to
physical
training
:
(
iii
)
structures
the
recovery
process

The
TQR
method
to
facilitate
monitoring
of
the
recovery
process
is
then
suggested
and
a
conceptual
model
that
incorporates
all
of
the
important
parameters
for
performance
gain
(
adaptation
)
and
loss
(
maladaptation
)

To
address
this
,
our
article
first
refers
to
the
main
aspects
of
salivary
gland
physiology

Both
salivary
output
and
composition
depend
on
the
activity
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system
and
any
modification
of
this
activity
can
be
observed
indirectly
by
alternations
in
the
salivary
excretion

The
effects
of
physical
activity
(
with
reference
to
factors
such
as
exercise
intensity
and
duration
,
or
type
of
exercise
protocol
)
on
salivary
composition
are
then
considered

Exercise
might
indeed
induce
changes
in
several
salivary
components
such
as
immunoglobulins
,
hormones
,
lactate
,
proteins
and
electrolytes

Beyond
a
certain
intensity
of
exercise
,
and
coinciding
with
the
accumulation
of
blood
lactate
(
anaerobic
threshold
or
AT
)
,
a
'saliva
threshold
'
(
Tsa
)
does
indeed
exist

The
occurrence
of
the
2
thresholds
(
AT
and
Tsa
)
might
,
in
turn
,
be
attributable
to
the
same
underlying
mechanism
,
that
of
increased
adrenal
sympathetic
activity
at
high
exercise
intensities

Fat
is
an
extremely
important
substrate
for
muscle
contraction
,
both
at
rest
and
during
exercise

Triglycerides
(
TGs
)
,
stored
in
adipose
tissue
and
within
muscle
fibres
,
are
considered
to
be
the
main
source
of
the
free
fatty
acids
(
FFAs
)
oxidised
during
exercise

It
is
still
unclear
,
however
,
how
the
use
of
these
substrates
is
regulated
during
exercise

The
regulation
seems
to
be
multifactorial
and
includes
:
(
i
)
dietary
and
nutritional
status
;
(
ii
)
hormonal
milieu
;
(
iii
)
exercise
mode
,
intensity
and
duration
;
and
(
iv
)
training
status

On
the
other
hand
,
the
mechanism
for
FFA
transport
from
its
storage
as
triglycerides
in
adipose
tissue
and
muscle
to
its
place
of
utilisation
in
heart
,
skeletal
muscle
,
kidney
and
liver
is
more
clearly
understood

Other
studies
have
found
that
during
prolonged
exercise
,
muscle
TGs
become
the
predominant
source
of
energy
obtained
from
fat

For
example
,
during
exercise
on
a
cycle
ergometer
,
nonplasma
FFAs
and
plasma
FFAs
contribute
40
%
,
and
carbohydrates
60
%
,
of
the
total
calculated
amount
of
energy
expenditure
before
exercise
and
vice
versa
after
exercise
(
60
%
nonplasma
and
plasma
FFAs
and
40
%
carbohydrates
)

Although
it
was
many
years
before
it
was
fully
demonstrated
,
fat
is
now
known
to
be
transported
in
the
blood
as
FFA
bound
to
the
protein
carrier
albumin

The
mobilisation
of
FFA
is
primarily
a
function
of
sympathetic
nervous
activity
directed
towards
the
adipocytes
,
or
the
'fat
pad
'
.
This
nervous
activity
can
be
direct
or
may
be
an
effect
of
circulating
catecholamines
such
as
adrenaline
(
epinephrine
)

This
article
summarises
the
role
of
fat
metabolism
during
exercise

As
the
clinical
availability
of
glycohaemoglobin/GHb
measurement
increases
,
so
does
the
need
for
comparable
and
accurate
values
among
different
laboratories
and
different
methods

At
least
there
should
be
comparability
,
i.e
.
,
commutability
or
feasibility
of
providing
comparable
results
from
different
assays
in
different
laboratories

Data
on
the
actual
state
of
inter-laboratory
and
inter-assay
differences
of
observed
values
were
useful
for
comparing
results
among
facilities

Even
after
correction
,
8
out
of
11
methods
still
remained
of
little
practical
use
because
of
their
large
relative
errors

Inter-method
differences
among
11
available
assay
methods
were
great
even
after
correction
and
depended
on
not
only
the
methods
but
the
samples
used
for
the
determination

The
performance
of
some
methods
or
instruments
used
are
only
poor
at
distinguishing
the
stable
glycated
haemoglobin
itself

Some
alternative
measurement
system
with
comparability
,
commutability
and
precision
should
be
established

An
urgent
and
worldwide
problem
to
remove
inter-laboratory
differences
in
the
measurement
of
GHb
needs
to
be
solved

The
results
show
that
87
%

even
in

background
:
we

stenoses

covered

noncovered
metallic
stents
were
used
for
the
esophageal
stenoses
,
except
in
1
patient
treated
with
a
silicone
stent

silicone
stents
were
used
for
the
tracheobronchial
stenoses

results
:
all
patients
experienced
improvement
of
grades
of
both
dysphagia
and
respiratory
symptoms
after
stent
therapy

because
placement
of
stents
in
both
the
esophagus
and
tracheobronchus
has
a
high
risk
of
enlargement
of
the
fistula
,
a
covered
metallic
stent
is
preferable
for
esophageal
cancer
involving
the
tracheobronchus

these
data

an
immunochemotherapeutic
regimen
consisting
of
interferon-alpha2b

neoadjuvant
therapy
with
oxaliplatin/fluorouracil/folinic

has
proven
beneficial
in
enabling
surgical
removal
of

were
40
and
50
%
,
respectively

in
patients
with

response
rate
which
did
not
differ
significantly
from
that
of

conclusion
:
oxaliplatin
in
combination
with
fluorouracil/folinic
acid
is
an
effective
treatment
option
for
patients
with
metastatic
colorectal
cancer
,
both
as

which
accounts
for
approximately
20
%
of
cases
of

,
the
primary

the
primary
aim
is
to
control
the
disease
which
generally
would
have
spread
beyond
the

at
the
time
of

a
growing
body
of
evidence
suggests
that
postoperative
irradiation
for
non-small

cancer
may
cause
life-threatening
toxicity
and
,
when
the
risk
of
local-regional
recurrence
is
low
,
the
toxicity
of
irradiation
may
outweight
the
benefit

as
a
best-case

cyclophosphamide
1000
mg/m2
every
3
weeks
with

with
intravenous
amifostine
910
mg/m2

over
6

conclusion
:
the
results
of
phase
iii
trials
have
confirmed
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
amifostine
as
a
cytoprotectant
to
ameliorate
cisplatin-induced
cumulative

,
for
which
it
is
the

depending
on
the
outcome
of

,
amifostine
may
eventually
find
broader
clinical

Chemotherapy
may
be
an
alternative

Three
patients
in
whom

This
study
indicates
that
BAM-M
is
effective
therapy
for

and
suggests
that
the
therapeutic

should
be
evaluated
further

Only

Traditional
therapy
for
malignant
pleural
effusions
includes
thoracentesis
or
tube
drainage
with
instillation
of
irritants
to
achieve
pleurodesis

We
feel
that
pleuroperitoneal
shunting
is
a
valid
new
method
for
treatment
of
malignant
pleural
effusions
which
can
effectively
palliate
respiratory
symptoms
with
low
morbidity

When
right
ventricular
failure
prohibits
separation
from
cardiopulmonary
bypass
,
standard
methods
of
increasing
pulmonary
blood
flow
should
be
employed
,
including
correction
of
hypoxia
and
acidosis
,
volume
loading
,
and
inotropic
support
of
the
right
ventricle

For
refractory
right
ventricular
failure
following
the
surgical
repair
of
congenital
cardiac
defects
in
which
the
placement
of
right
atrial
and
pulmonary
artery
cannulae
is
not
technically
feasible
,
use
of
high-frequency
high-volume
ventilation
appears
to
be
quite
promising

Current
results
suggest
that
RHBP
remains
the
gold
standard
for
severe
RV
failure
,
but
further
clinical
experience
with
PABC
may
more
clearly
define
its
role
in
the
management
of
RV
failure

However
,
the
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
procainamide
may
be
effective
in
suppressing
the
induction
of
sustained

tachycardia
at
a
relatively
low
plasma
concentration
,
but
not
at
a

Initial

should
be
based
on
the
possibility
that
penicillin-resistant

,
hence
,
should
include
a
combination
of
third-generation

OBJECTIVES
:
Interest
in
zinc
as
a
treatment
for
the
common
cold
has
grown
following
the
recent
publication
of
several
controlled
trials

The
objective
of
this
review
was
to
assess
the
effects
of
zinc
lozenges
for
cold
symptoms

Results
from
two
trials
(
04
-
Mossad
;
08
-
Smith
)
suggested
zinc
lozenges
reduced
the
severity
and
duration
of
cold
symptoms

Given
the
potential
for
treatment
to
produce
side
effects
,
the
use
of
zinc
lozenges
to
treat
cold
symptoms
deserves
further
study

Randomized
trial
of
interferon-alpha
plus
ursodeoxycholic
acid
versus
interferon
plus
placebo
in
patients
with
chronic
hepatitis
C
resistant
to
interferon

We
describe
a
rare
case
of
spontaneous
rupture
of
a
hepatic
metastasis
from
renal
cell
carcinoma
that
was
treated
successfully
by
hepatic
arterial
embolization

A
65-year-old
woman
,
who
had
been
undergoing
immunotherapy
for
inoperably
disseminated
renal
carcinoma
and
lung
metastases
,
presented
with
severe
abdominal
pain
in
a
state
of
hypovolemic
shock

Although
hepatic
rupture
due
to
metastatic
cancer
is
extremely
rare
,
transcatheter
arterial
embolization
(
TAE
)
is
an
appropriate
and
useful
treatment
for
massive
hemorrhage
caused
by
spontaneous
rupture
of
liver
metastasis

Surgical
treatment
is
a
good
alternative
for
patients
with
persistent
severe
regurgitation
during
medical
therapy
and
for
young
patients
who
prefer
surgery
to
lifelong
medication

Despite
this
,
cholecystectomy
as
a
treatment
for
biliary
dyskinesia
remains
controversial

Our
aim
was
to
determine
efficacy
of
cholecystectomy
in
alleviating
biliary
dyskinesia
symptoms
and
the
correlation
with
histologic
findings

CONCLUSIONS
:
Biliary
dyskinesia
patients
who
underwent
cholecystectomy
had
significantly
greater
symptom
improvement
compared
with
nonsurgical
patients

Transbronchial
biopsy
revealed
inflammatory
nonspecific
alveolar
lesions
suggestive
of
bronchiolitis
obliterans
organizing
pneumonia
,
which
responded
well
clinically
and
radiologically
to
oral
corticosteroids

Novel
treatment
strategies
for
patients
with
advanced
NSCLC
may
involve
chemotherapy
combined
with
inhibition
of
NF-kappaB-dependent
cell-survival
pathways

OBJECTIVE
:
This
retrospective
study
was
designed
to
confirm
that
aggressive
pulmonary
resection
can
provide
effective
long-term
palliation
of
disease
for
patients
with
pulmonary
aspergilloma

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
expression
and
therapeutic
potential
of
TRAIL
in
cholangiocarcinoma
,
one
of
the
most
devastating
human
hepatic
malignancies

Finally
,
in
vivo
administration
of
recombinant
TRAIL
substantially
inhibited
subcutaneous
tumor
growth
of
human
cholangiocarcinoma
cells

Induction
of
apoptosis
in
tumor
cells
is
possible
with
a
biologically
active
TRAIL
,
and
suggests
that
this
cytokine
is
a
promising
antitumor
agent
against
human
cholangiocarcinoma

This
study
investigated
whether
intensive

after
completion
of

PURPOSE
:
Inhaled
corticosteroids
have
beneficial
effects
on
pulmonary

inflammation
in
patients
with

,
but
they
also
cause
systemic
adverse

,
such
as

Thus
,
s-ECP
appears
to
be
a
useful
marker
for
determining
when
a
step-down
in
iBDP
therapy
is
indicated
,
and
thus
may
contribute
to

management
of
chronic

Twinrix
(

A
two-dose
combined

A
and
B

would
facilitate
immunisation
programs

Therefore
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
with
two
injections
of
the
high-dose
hepatitis
A
and
B
vaccine
,
6
months

has
encouraged
assessment
of
alternative
agents
,
for

to
be
an
antiviral
agent
in
mice
infected
with
a

The
purpose
of
the

BACKGROUND
:
The
administration
of
salbutamol
is
permitted
only
by
inhalation
by
the
International
Olympic
Committee
(
IOC
)
for
the
management
of
asthma
and
exercise-induced
asthma
in
athletes

Urine
was
also
obtained
from
subjects
who
had
received
the
maximum
dosage
of
inhaled
salbutamol
advisable
for
competing
athletes
to
provide
protection
from

OBJECTIVE
:
to
evaluate
the
possible
existence
of
the
so-called
<
Roux-en-Y
syndrome
>
in
a
group
of
21
patients
who
underwent
surgery
to
correct
postoperative
alkaline
reflux
gastritis

All
had
undergone
Billroth
II
subtotal
gastrectomy
(
20
for
ulcer
and
1
for
gastric
cancer
)

CONCLUSIONS
:
we
found
no
evidence
of
disturbances
in
gastric
remnant
emptying
after
Roux-en-Y
gastrojejunostomy
to
treat
postoperative
alkaline
gastric
reflux

CONCLUSIONS
:
This
study
indicates
that
the
use
of
a
computerized
physician
reminder
and
a
mailed
patient
reminder
had
a
positive
impact
on
influenza
immunizations
for
older
adults
in
a

A
series
of
comparative
analyses
show
that
inhaled
fluticasone
propionate
is
more
cost
effective
than
oral
zafirlukast
and
triamcinolone
acetonide
and
slightly
more
cost
effective
than
flunisolide
in
adult
patients
with
asthma

Quality-of-life
assessments
in
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
disease
show
that
inhaled
fluticasone
propionate
achieved
improvements
which
were
deemed
to
be
clinically
meaningful
in
patients
with
mild
to
moderate
asthma
;
these
changes
were
significantly
greater
than
those
achieved
with
oral
zafirlukast
,
inhaled
triamcinolone
acetonide
or
placebo

CONCLUSIONS
:
In
addition
to
the
considerable
body
of
clinical
evidence
supporting
the
use
of
inhaled
fluticasone
propionate
in
patients
with
asthma
,
accumulating
short
term
cost-effectiveness
data
also
suggest
that
this
agent
can
be
administered
for
a
similar
or
lower
cost
per
outcome
than
other
inhaled
corticosteroids
or
oral
zafirlukast

Importantly
,
the
clinical
benefits
offered
by
fluticasone
propionate
in
patients
with
persistent
asthma
are
accompanied
by
clinically
significant
improvements
in
quality
of
life

OBJECTIVE
:
To

to
AIDS
or
death

In
patients
with
combination
therapy
,
a
further
reduction
of
viremia
level
could
be
observed
,
whereas
viremia
levels
in
patients
with
IFN
alpha
alone
slightly
increased

Ribavirin
in
combination
with
IFN
alpha
exerts
an
additional
anti-viral/immunmodulatory
effect
which

The
recent
introduction
of
ribavirin
,
given
in
combination
,
has
led
to
a
re-appraisal
of
the
management
of
chronic

The
current
report
considers
the
additional

)
compared
with
monotherapy
(

CONCLUSION
:
Although
tacrolimus
is

colitis
,
fewer
than
50
%
of

We
observed
the
effects
of
cisapride
in
the

history
of
constipation
(
i.e
.
,
pain
and
difficulty
or
delay
in
defecation
for
>
3
months
)
were
recruited
and
randomly
assigned
to
8
weeks
of
treatment
with
either
cisapride
,
0.2
mg/kg
three
times
daily
,
or
matching
placebo
after
a
2-week
run-in
period
in
a
double-blind
,
parallel-group
study
design

Patient
1
demonstrated
dramatic
clearing
of
his
MCV
lesions
when
intravenous
cidofovir
therapy
was
started
for
his
treatment-resistant
bilateral
CMV
retinitis
and
because
of
cidofovir
's
possible
activity
against
MCV

In
case
2
,
cidofovir
was
compounded
as
a
3
%
cream
in
a
combination
vehicle
(
Dermovan
)
for
extensive
facial
involvement
,
and
complete
resolution
of
MCV
was
seen
after
1
month
of
therapy

In
case
3
,
intravenous
cidofovir
therapy
was
started
both
for
CMV
retinitis
and
in
an
attempt
to
clear
90
%
facial
MCV
involvement
;
after
1
month
of
treatment
,
all
clinical
evidence
of
MCV
had
resolved

CONCLUSIONS
:
Cidofovir
,
a
nucleotide
analog
of
deoxycytidine
monophosphate
,
appears
to
have
contributed
to
clearing
of
advanced
MCV
lesions
in
these
3
patients
,
thus
providing
suggestive
evidence
of
clinical
activity
against
MCV

Controlled
trials
of
cidofovir
therapy
for
MCV
in
persons
infected
with
human

are
warranted

A

We
conclude
that
bolus

may
facilitate
spontaneous

in
select
patients
with
confirmed
acute

Although
improved
glycemic

,
maintenance
of

,
and
use
of
angiotensin-converting

are
important
strategies
to
avoid
developing

,
dietary

may
also
play
a
role

well
as
response
rates
that
are
comparable
or
superior
to
those
achieved
with
chemotherapy

CONCLUSION
:
The
treatment
paradigm
for
NHL
is
expected
to
change
over
the
next
few
years
to
include
radiolabeled
mAbs
,
administered
alone
or
in
combination
with
cytotoxic
agents

RESULTS
:
Clinical
trials
of
UFT
published
in
the
Western
world
have
included
581
patients
with
colorectal
cancer

CONCLUSION
:
Adrenal-sparing
surgery
is
safe
and
effective
,
and
may
become
the
treatment
of
choice
in
patients
with
hereditary
phaeochromocytoma

<

PURPOSE
:
The
purposes
of
this
descriptive
,
longitudinal
study
were
to
evaluate
the
MacDibbs
Mouth
Assessment
instrument
for
the
assessment
of
mucositis
in
the
radiation
therapy
patient
being
treated
for
head
and
neck
cancer
and
to
describe
the
course
of
radiation-induced
mucositis
in
these
patients

As
concomitant
thrombocytosis
persisted
despite

,
the

and

within
11
days

Background
:
Troglitazone
is
a
new
drug
for
the

of

For
a
subset
of
patients
with
Kaposi
's
sarcoma
who
were
treated
with
recombinant
interferon
alfa-2a
,
the
disease
is
in
complete
remission
,
without
opportunistic
infection
,
and
they
appear
to
be
culture-negative
for
the
etiologic
retrovirus
that
causes
their
immune
deficiency

Interferon
alfa-2a
appears
to
have
antineoplastic
efficacy
,
(
and
may
have
antiretroviral
efficacy
as
well
)
in
this
epidemic
neoplasm

In
three
consecutive
Phase
II
trials
of
recombinant
interferon
alfa-2a
(
rIFN
alfa-2a
;
Roferon-A
Hoffmann-La
Roche
,
Nutley
,
NJ
)
involving
96
patients
with
advanced
malignant
melanoma
,
an
overall
response
rate
of
22
%
was
observed

Preliminary
evidence
suggests
that
interferons
beta
and
gamma
may
also
induce
regression
of
metastatic
renal
cell
carcinoma

Splenectomy
presumably
alleviates
the
pancytopenic
effect
of
hypersplenism
by
removing
the
preferred
site
of
leukemic
cell
proliferation

This
approach
is
being
extended
to
the
clinic
,
and
trials
are
now
underway
evaluating
combinations
of
interferon
and
various
cytotoxic
drugs
known
from
previous
studies
to
be
active
in
patients
with
low-grade
non-Hodgkin
's
lymphomas

The
data
resulting
from
these
clinical
trials
indicate
that
interferon
alfa-2a
is
effective
in
inducing
hematologic
remissions
in
the
majority
of
minimally
treated
,
benign-phase
CML
,
Ph1-positive
patients

More
than
1600
patients
with
neoplastic
disorders
have
received
recombinant
human
interferon
alfa-2a
(
Roferon-A
,
Hoffmann-La
Roche
,
Nutley
,
NJ
)
as
part
of
ongoing
or
completed
clinical
trials

PURPOSE
:
A

(
5-FU
)
,
and

for
patients
with

cell
carcinoma
of
the
head

PATIENTS
AND

:
Twenty-three

SCCHN
and
Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology
Group
functional
status
less

were
treated
with
TPFL5

BACKGROUND
:
The
effectiveness
of
LTG
as
add-on
therapy
for
partial
seizures
in
adults
has
previously
been
established

CONCLUSIONS
:
We
conclude
that
LTG
is
effective
and
well
tolerated
when
administered
as
monotherapy
in
adult
patients
with
partial
seizures

BACKGROUND
:
Omega3
fatty
acids
may
inhibit
neuronal
signal
transduction
pathways
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
lithium
carbonate
and
valproate
,
2
effective
treatments
for
bipolar
disorder

The
present
study
was
performed
to
examine
whether
omega3
fatty
acids
also
exhibit
mood-stabilizing
properties
in
bipolar
disorder

CONCLUSION
:
Omega3
fatty
acids
were
well
tolerated
and
improved
the
short-term
course
of
illness
in
this
preliminary
study
of
patients
with
bipolar
disorder

Several
